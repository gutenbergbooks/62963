<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span></h2>
<p>The dining-room of Molloy&rsquo;s flat had not been built
to receive twenty-five guests, but the Delegates
of twenty-five affiliated Organisations had been
crowded into it. The unshaded electric light glared
down upon men of many types and nationalities.
It did not flatter them.</p>
<p>The air was heavy with the smoke of bad tobacco
and the fumes of a very indifferent gas fire. There
was a table in the middle of the room, and some dozen
of the men were seated at it. The rest stood in groups,
or leaned against the walls.</p>
<p>Of the four who formed the Inner Council three
were present. Most of the Delegates had expected
that the head of The Council, the head of the Federated
Organisations, that mysterious Number One
whom they all knew by reputation and yet had
never seen in the flesh, would be present in person
to take the chair. But the Delegates who had entertained
this expectation were doomed to disappointment.
Once again Number One&rsquo;s authority had been
delegated to the other three members of The Council.
Of these, Number Three was Molloy, the big, handsome
Irishman who rented the flat. He sat facing the
door, a fine figure of a man in the late forties. Number
Two leaned forward over the fire, warming his hands,
his pale, intellectual face expressionless, his eyes
veiled. Belcovitch, who was Number Four, was on
his feet speaking. They were large, bony feet, in boots
which had most noticeably not been made for him.
He spoke fluently, but with a heavy foreign accent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Propaganda,&rdquo; he said, and laughed; really he
had a very unpleasant laugh&mdash;&ldquo;propaganda is what
you call rot, rubbish, damn nonsense. What else
have we been about for years&mdash;no, generations&mdash;and
where are we to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number Two drew his chair closer to the fire with
an impatient jerk. Number Four&rsquo;s oratory bored him
stiff. The room was cold. This gas fire was like all
gas fires. He pulled his fur coat together and spoke
sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molloy, this room&rsquo;s most infernally cold, and
where in the world does the draught come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Propaganda is dead,&rdquo; said Number Four. He
looked over his shoulder with dislike at Number Two,
and mopped his brow with a dirty handkerchief.
Molloy, just opposite him, turned a little and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bring the cold with you, Number Two,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Number Four as hot as his own speeches.
You&rsquo;ve got all the fire, and the door&rsquo;s shut, and a
screen in front of it, so what more do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Propaganda is dead,&rdquo; repeated Number Four. He
stood with his back to the door. Only the top panel
of it showed above the black screen which had been
drawn across it. The screen had four leaves. On
each leaf a golden stork on one leg contemplated a
golden water-lily. The light shone on the golden
birds and the golden flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Number Four thrust his handkerchief back into his
pocket, and rapped sharply on the table. It was
covered with a red cloth which had seen better days.
Number Fourteen had upset the ink only a few
moments before, and a greenish-purple patch was still
spreading amidst the crimson.</p>
<p>Belcovitch leaned forward, both his hands on the
table, his raucous voice brought to a dead level.
&ldquo;Instead of propaganda, what?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Instead
of building here, teaching there, what? That is what
I&rsquo;m here to-night to tell you. To-morrow you all go
to your own places, each to his post; but before you
go, I am authorised to prepare you for what is to come.
It will not be to-day, but it may be to-morrow, or
it may not be for many to-morrows yet. One final
stage is lacking, but in essentials The Process is complete.
Propaganda is dead, because we no longer
need propaganda. Comrades&rdquo;&mdash;his voice sank a
little&mdash;&ldquo;there are enough of us. Every city in the
world has its quota. What The Process will effect&rdquo;&mdash;he
paused, looked round, caught Number Two&rsquo;s
slightly sardonic expression, and struck the table
with his open hand&mdash;&ldquo;what The Process will effect
is this,&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;in one word, Annihilation of the
whole human race! Only our organisation will be
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what I am instructed to tell you is this,&rdquo;&mdash;he
spoke evenly, swiftly, statement following statement&mdash;never
had the attention of an audience been so
fully his; and then suddenly the thread was broken.
With a loud grating sound, Number Fifteen, sitting
next to Molloy, pushed his chair back, and sprang to
his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;The door!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The door!&rdquo; Every
man in the room looked where Fifteen was looking.
Above the water-lilies and the storks, where the top
panel of the door had shown, there was a dark, empty
space. The door was open.</p>
<p>Number Four whipped out a revolver and dragged
the screen away. The door was open, and in the
doorway stood a girl in her nightdress. Her hands
were stretched out, as if she were feeling her way.
Her eyes, of a greenish hazel in colour, were widely
opened, and had a dazed expression. Her brown hair
hung in two neat plaits. Her feet were bare. Molloy
pushed forward quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there, if that wasn&rsquo;t the start of our lives,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and no reason for it when all&rsquo;s said and done.
It&rsquo;s my daughter, Renata, comrades, and she&rsquo;s walking
in her sleep. Now I&rsquo;ll just take her back to her room
and be with you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minute, I think, Molloy,&rdquo; said Number Two.
He got up slowly out of his chair, and came across to
where the girl stood motionless, blinking at the light.
&ldquo;I <i>said</i> there was a most infernal draught. Will
you come in, Miss Molloy?&rdquo; he added politely, and
took the girl by the hand. She yielded to his touch, and
came into the room, shivering a little. Some one shut
the door. Molloy, shrugging his shoulders, pulled
the crimson cloth from the table and wrapped it about
his daughter. The ink-soaked patch came upon her
bare shoulder, and she cried out, cast a wild look at
the strange and terrifying faces about her, and burst
into a flood of tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Molloy, standing behind her, looked around as she
had looked, and his face darkened. Number Four
had his back against the door, and his revolver in his
hand. There was only one face in the whole circle
that was not stamped with suspicion and fear, and
behind the fear and the suspicion there was something
icy, something ruthless. Number Two, with a slightly
bored expression, was feeling in his waistcoat pocket.
He produced a small glass bottle, extracted from it
a tiny pellet, and proceeded to dissolve it in the glass of
water which had stood neglected at Number Four&rsquo;s
right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Molloy,&rdquo; he said, but Molloy caught
him by the wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, and Number
Two laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Molloy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how crude! You
might know me better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the glass to Renata&rsquo;s lips, and she took it
and drank. When she had set down the glass, she
felt her way to a chair and leaned back with closed
eyes. The room seemed to whirl about her. A confusion
of sound was in her ears, loud, angry, with
sentences that came and went. &ldquo;If she heard,&rdquo;&mdash;then
another&mdash;&ldquo;How long was she there? Some one must
have seen the door open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did, then?&rdquo; Then in the harshest voice
of all, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if she&rsquo;s Molloy&rsquo;s daughter fifty
times over, if she heard what Four said about The
Process, she must go.&rdquo; Go where?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>There was something cold and wet touching her
shoulder. The cold seemed to spread all over her.
Now her father was speaking. She had never heard
his voice quite like that before. And now the man in
the fur coat, the one who had given her the glass of
water:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, elimination if it is necessary.
We&rsquo;re all agreed about that. But let us make sure.&rdquo;
His voice had quite a gentle sound, but Renata&rsquo;s heart
began to beat with great thuds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy,&rdquo;&mdash;he was speaking to her now, and
she opened her eyes and looked at him. His face was
of a clear, even pallor. His eyes, light blue and
without noticeable lashes, looked straight into hers.
The veil was gone from them. They held a terrifying
intelligence.</p>
<p>Renata sat up. The crowd of men had cleared
away. She, and her father, and the man in the fur
coat were in an angle formed by the table and the
black screen, which had been drawn close around
them. Her father sat between her and the fire. His
head was turned away, and he drummed incessantly
on the table with the fingers of his right hand.
Beyond the screen Renata could hear movements,
and it came to her that the other men were there,
waiting. The man in the fur coat spoke to her
again. His voice was pleasant and cultivated, his
manner reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are better now? Please don&rsquo;t be frightened.
I am a doctor; your father will tell you that. Being
wakened suddenly like that gave you a shock, but you
are better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Renata. She wished that her heart
would stop beating so hard, and she wished that the
man in the fur coat would stop looking at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Renata, I am your doctor, you know,
and I want you to answer just a few questions. You
have walked in your sleep before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Renata&mdash;&ldquo;oh yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the first time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;I think I was five years old. They
found me in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy let out a great breath of relief. If she had
forgotten, if her account had differed from his&mdash;well,
well, their luck was in.</p>
<p>There was a whispering from behind the screen.
Number Two frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the last time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at school. I walked into another dormitory
and frightened the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the fur coat nodded. &ldquo;So your father
said.&rdquo; And for a moment Molloy stared over his
shoulder at him. &ldquo;And to-night? Do you dream on
these occasions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renata was reassured. Every moment it was more
like an ordinary visit to a doctor. She had been asked
all these questions so often. Her voice no longer
trembled as she answered. &ldquo;Yes, I dream. I walk
in my sleep because of the dream; now to-night....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamt I was back at school, and I thought I
heard talking in the next dormitory. You know we
are not allowed to talk, and I am&mdash;I mean I was a
prefect. So I got up, and went to see what was the
matter, and some one pulled the screen away, and
there was such a light, and such a noise.&rdquo; She put out
a shaking hand, and Number Two patted it kindly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very startling for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So you opened
the door and came in and heard us all talking. Can
you tell me what was being said?&rdquo; His hand was
on Renata&rsquo;s wrist, and he felt the pulses leap. She
spoke a shade too quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can help you. Your father, you know,
travels for a firm of chemists, a firm in which I and my
friends are also interested. We were discussing a new
aniline dye which, we hope, will capture the markets of
the world. Now did you hear that word&mdash;aniline&mdash;or
anything like it? You see I want to find out just
what woke you. What tiresome questions we doctors
ask, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, and Renata tried to collect her thoughts.
They were in great confusion.</p>
<p>Aniline&mdash;annihilate&mdash;the two words kept coming and
going. If her head had been clearer she would almost
certainly have fallen into the trap which had been laid
for her. Molloy stopped drumming on the table and
clenched his hand. With all his strength he was praying
to the saints in whom he no longer believed. Behind
the screen twenty-three men waited in a dead silence.
Renata was not frightened any more, but she was tired&mdash;oh,
so dreadfully tired. Annihilate&mdash;aniline&mdash;the
words and their similarity of sound teased her. She
turned from them with a little burst of petulance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything like that. Oh, do let me go
to bed! I only heard some one call out....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Number Two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;The door, the door!&rsquo; and then there were
all those lights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span></h2>
<p>Jane Smith sat on a bench in Kensington
Gardens. Her entire worldly fortune lay in her
lap. It consisted of two shillings and eleven pence.
She had already counted the pennies four times,
because there really should have been three shillings.
She was now engaged in making a list in parallel columns
of (<i>a</i>) those persons from whom she might seek
financial assistance, and (<i>b</i>) the excellent reasons
which prevented her from approaching them.</p>
<p>Jane had a passion for making lists. Years and
years and years ago Mr. Carruthers had said to her,
&ldquo;My dear, you must learn to be businesslike. I have
never been businesslike myself, and it has always
been a great trouble to me.&rdquo; And then and there he
and Jane had, in collaboration, embarked upon the
First List. It was a thrilling list, a list of toys for
Jane&rsquo;s very first Christmas tree. Since then she had
made lists of her books, lists of her clothes, shopping
lists, and an annual list of good resolutions.</p>
<p>Jane stopped writing, and began to think about all
those other lists. She had always showed them to
Mr. Carruthers, and he had always gazed at them with
the same vague benignness, and said how businesslike
she was getting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Dear Cousin James&mdash;Jane was rich instead of poor
when she thought about him. She looked across at
the trees in their new mist of green, and then suddenly
the thin April sunshine dazzled in her eyes and the
green swam into a blur. Cousin James was gone, and
Jane was alone in Kensington Gardens with two-and-elevenpence
and a list.</p>
<p>She opened and shut her eyes very quickly once or
twice, and fixed her attention upon (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) in their
parallel columns. At the top of the list Jane had
written &ldquo;Cousin Louisa,&rdquo; and the reason against
asking Cousin Louisa&rsquo;s assistance was set down as,
&ldquo;Because she was a perfect beast to my darling Jimmy,
and a worse beast to me, and anyhow, she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In moments of irreverence the late Mr. Carruthers&mdash;<i>the</i>
Mr. Carruthers, author of five monumental volumes
on Ethnographical Differentiation&mdash;had been addressed
by his young ward and cousin as &ldquo;darling Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Philpot came next. &ldquo;A darling, but he is
sitting somewhere in Central Africa in a cage learning
to talk gorilla. I do hope they haven&rsquo;t eaten him, or
whatever they do do to people when they catch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be observed that Miss Smith&rsquo;s association
with the world of science had not succeeded in chastening
her grammar.</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s pencil travelled down the list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bruce Murray. In Thibet studying Llamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry&rdquo;&mdash;Jane shook her head and solemnly put
two thick black lines through Henry&rsquo;s name. One
cannot ask for financial assistance from a young man
whose hand one has refused in marriage&mdash;&ldquo;even if it
was three years ago, and he&rsquo;s probably been in love
with at least fifteen girls since then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Henry&rsquo;s mamma&mdash;well, the only time she ever
loved me in her life was when I refused Henry, so I
should think she was an Absolute Wash Out&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane folded up the list and put it into her handbag.
Two silver shillings and eleven copper pennies, and
then the workhouse!</p>
<p>It was at this moment that a stout lady with a ginger-coloured
pug sat heavily down upon the far end of
Jane&rsquo;s bench. The ginger-coloured pug was on a
scarlet leather lead, and after seating herself the stout
lady bent forward creaking, and lifted him to a place
beside her.</p>
<p>Jane wondered vaguely why a red face and a tightly
curled fringe should go with a passion for bugled
bonnets and pugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was &rsquo;ums hungry?&rdquo; said the stout lady.</p>
<p>The pug breathed stertorously, after the manner of
pugs, and his mistress at once produced two paper
bags from a beaded reticule. From one of them she
took a macaroon, and from the other a sponge finger.
The pug chose the macaroon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precious,&rdquo; cooed the stout lady, and all at once
Jane felt entirely capable of theft and murder&mdash;theft
from the stout lady, and murder upon the person of
the ginger pug. For at the sight of food she realised
how very, very hungry she was. Bread and margarine
for breakfast six hours before, and the April air was
keen, and Jane was young.</p>
<p>The pug spat out the last mouthful of macaroon,
ignored the sponge finger, and snorted loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, naughty, naughty,&rdquo; said the stout lady. She
half turned towards Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;You really wouldn&rsquo;t believe how clever he is,&rdquo; she
observed conversationally; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a cream bun he&rsquo;s
asking for as plain as plain, and yesterday when I
bought them for him, he teased and teased until I
went back for macaroons; though, of course, a nice
plain sponge finger is really better for him than either.
I don&rsquo;t need the vet. to tell me that. Come along, a
naughty, tiresome precious then.&rdquo; She lifted the pug
down from the seat, put the paper bags tidily back
into her reticule, rose ponderously to her feet, and
walked away, trailing the scarlet lead and cooing to
the ginger pug.</p>
<p>Jane watched her go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I laugh?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t
she amuse me? One needn&rsquo;t lose one&rsquo;s sense of humour
even if one is down and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at this unpropitious moment that the tall
young man who had sat down unseen upon Jane&rsquo;s
other side, laid his hand upon hers and observed in
stirring accents:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane whisked round in an icy temper. Her greenish-hazel
eyes looked through the young man in the direction
of the north pole. He ought to have stiffened
to an icicle then and there, instead of which he murmured,
&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; again, and then added&mdash;&ldquo;but
what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Jane stopped looking at him
or through him. He had simply ceased to exist. She
picked up her two shillings and her eleven pence, put
them into her purse, and consigned her purse to her
handbag. She then closed the handbag with a snap,
and rose to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man in tones of
consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Jane paused and allowed herself to observe him for
the first time. She saw a young man with an intellectual
forehead and studious brown eyes. He appeared
to be hurt and surprised. She decided that this was
not a would-be Lothario.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have made a mistake,&rdquo; she said, and
was about to pass on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Renata, Renata, darling!&rdquo; stammered the
young man even more desperately. Jane assumed
what Cousin Louisa had once described as &ldquo;that
absurdly grand manner.&rdquo; It was quite kind, but it
induced the young man to believe that Jane was
conversing with him from about the distance of the
planet Saturn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you must be taking me
for my cousin, Renata Molloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m engaged to her&mdash;no, I mean to you&mdash;oh,
hang it all, Renata, what&rsquo;s the sense of a silly joke like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked at him keenly. &ldquo;What is my cousin&rsquo;s
middle name?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane. I hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;My name is Jane
Renata Smith, and I am Renata Jane Molloy&rsquo;s
first cousin. Our mothers were twin sisters, and
I have always understood that we were very much
alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alike!&rdquo; gasped the young man. Words seemed
to fail him.</p>
<p>Jane bowed slightly and began to walk away, but,
before she had gone a dozen paces, he was beside her
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really Renata&rsquo;s cousin, I want to talk to
you&mdash;I must talk to you. Will you let me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Jane walked as far as the next seat, and sat down
with resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Todhunter&mdash;Arnold Todhunter.&rdquo; He seemed
a trifle breathless. &ldquo;My sister Daphne was at school
with Renata, and she came to stay with us once in the
holidays. I said we were engaged, didn&rsquo;t I? Only,
nobody knows it. You won&rsquo;t tell Mr. Molloy, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never spoken to Mr. Molloy in my life,&rdquo;
said Jane. &ldquo;There was a most awful row when
my aunt married him, and none of us have ever met
each other since. My aunt died years and years
ago. I think Mr. Molloy is an Anarchist of some
sort, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Todhunter, with violence.
He banged the back of the iron seat with his hand.
Jane reflected that he must be very much in love if
he failed to notice how hard it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, he is,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Todhunter, &ldquo;and
worse; and Renata is in the most dreadful position.
I must talk to somebody, or I shall go mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can talk to me,&rdquo; said Jane soothingly.
&ldquo;I have always wanted to meet Renata, and I should
love to hear all about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Todhunter hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Smith&mdash;you did say Smith, didn&rsquo;t you?&mdash;it&rsquo;s
so difficult to begin. You&rsquo;ll probably think I&rsquo;m
mad, or trying it on, but it&rsquo;s like this: I&rsquo;ve just
qualified as an engineer, and I&rsquo;ve got a job in South
America. Naturally I wanted to see Mr. Molloy.
Renata wouldn&rsquo;t let me. She hardly knows her
father, and she&rsquo;s most awfully scared of him. We
used to meet in the Park. Then one day she didn&rsquo;t
come. She went on not coming, and I nearly went
mad. At last I went to Molloy&rsquo;s flat and asked to see
her. They said she had left town, but it was a lie.
Just before the door shut, I heard her voice.&rdquo; Mr.
Todhunter paused. &ldquo;Look here, you won&rsquo;t give any
of this away, will you? You know, it&rsquo;s awfully confusing
for me, your being so like Renata. It makes
my head go round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the bit I don&rsquo;t want you to tell any one is
this&mdash;I mean to say, it&rsquo;s confidential, absolutely
confidential: when I was at the Engineering School,
I knew a chap who had got mixed up with Molloy&rsquo;s
lot. He didn&rsquo;t get deep in, you&rsquo;ll understand. They
scared him, and he backed out. Well, I remembered
a yarn he had told me. He was in Molloy&rsquo;s flat one
night, and it was raided. And I remembered that he
said a lot of them got away down the fire-escape into
a yard, and then out through some mews at the back.
Well, I went and nosed about until I found that fire-escape,
and I got up it, and I found Renata&rsquo;s room
and talked to her through the window. It&rsquo;s not so
dangerous as it sounds, because they lock her in the
flat at night, and go out. And she&rsquo;s in a frightful
position&mdash;oh, Miss Smith, you simply have no idea of
what a frightful position she&rsquo;s in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have, if you would tell me what it is,&rdquo; said
Jane dryly. She found Mr. Todhunter diffuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a prisoner, to start with. They keep
her locked in her room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s they?&rdquo; interrupted Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Mr. Todhunter rumpled his hair. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t
even know their names,&rdquo; he said distractedly. His
voice dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most appalling
criminal organisation, Miss Smith. Molloy&rsquo;s one of
them, but they won&rsquo;t even let Molloy see her alone
now. You see, they think she overheard something.
They don&rsquo;t know whether she did or not. If they were
sure that she did, they would kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did she?&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Todhunter gloomily.
&ldquo;She cried such a lot, and we were both rather confused,
and she&rsquo;s most awfully frightened, you know.&rdquo;
He glared at Jane as if she had something to do with
Renata being frightened. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to take up this
job of mine, I have to sail in three days&rsquo; time. I
want her to marry me and come too; but she says
that, if she runs away, they&rsquo;ll make sure she heard
something, and, if it&rsquo;s the farthest ends of the earth,
they&rsquo;ll find her and kill her. It seems Molloy told her
that. And if she stays here and they bully her again,
she doesn&rsquo;t know what she may give away. It&rsquo;s a
frightful position, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the police?&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that, but they&rsquo;d laugh at me. I
haven&rsquo;t heard anything, and I don&rsquo;t know anything.
Molloy would only say that Renata was under age,
and that he had locked her in to prevent her running
away with me. Then they&rsquo;d kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jane. Then&mdash;&ldquo;What do you want
me to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>All the time that Mr. Todhunter had been glooming
and groaning, running his fingers through his hair
and depicting Renata&rsquo;s appalling position, the Great
Idea had been slowly forming itself in his mind. Every
time that he looked at Jane, her likeness to Renata
made him feel quite giddy. The Great Idea intoxicated
him. He began to decant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Smith, if you would&mdash;you see, if we could
only get a clear start&mdash;what I mean to say is, South
America&rsquo;s a long way off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a distance,&rdquo; Jane agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they thought that you were Renata, they
wouldn&rsquo;t look for her&mdash;and once we were clear
away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>dear</i> Mr. Todhunter!&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could take you up the fire-escape,&rdquo; said Mr.
Todhunter, in low, thrilling accents. &ldquo;It would be
quite easy. They would never know that Renata
was not there. You do see what I mean, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Jane in rather an odd voice.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made it beautifully clear. Renata is in a
position of deadly peril&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s what you
called it&mdash;and the simple way out is for Renata to
elope with you to South America, and for me to be in
the position of deadly peril instead. It&rsquo;s a beautiful
plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo; exclaimed the oblivious Mr.
Todhunter.</p>
<p>Jane looked away. Immediately in front of her
was a strip of gravelled path. Beyond that there was
green grass, and a bed of pale blue hyacinths, and
budding daffodils. Two-and-elevenpence, and then
the workhouse&mdash;the ascent of a fire-escape in the
April darkness, and at the top of the fire-escape a
position of deadly peril.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jane, speaking to herself in her
own mind. &ldquo;I might try to be a housemaid, but one
has to have a character, and I don&rsquo;t believe Cousin
Louisa would give me one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned back to the chafing Mr. Todhunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; she said briefly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span></h2>
<p>Jane took down the telephone directory, opened it,
and began to run her finger along the column of
&ldquo;M&rsquo;s.&rdquo; As she did so, she wondered why the light
in public call offices is so arranged as to strike the top
of the occupant&rsquo;s head, and never by any chance to
illumine the directory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marbot&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Marbottle&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;March, The Rev.
Aloysius&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;March, George William Adolphus&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;March,
Mrs. de Luttrelle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane made a mark opposite the number.</p>
<p>When Rosa Mortimer married Henry Luttrell
March, she thought, and often said, how much nicer
the Luttrell would look if it were written de Luttrelle.
If her husband had died six months earlier than he
actually did, the name in this improved form would
most certainly have been inflicted upon an infant
Henry. As it was, the child was baptized and registered
as Henry Luttrell, and ten years later took up the
struggle over the name where his father had left it.
Eventually, a compromise was effected, Mrs. March
flaunting her de Luttrelle, and Henry tending to suppress
his Luttrell under an initial. His mother never
ceased to bemoan his stubbornness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any one would think that Henry was not proud
of his family, and he may say what he likes, but there
were de Luttrelles for hundreds of years before any one
ever heard of a Luttrell. And Luttrell Marches is
bound to come to him, or practically bound to, because,
whatever Henry may say, I am quite sure that Tony
will never turn up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very sound of the aggrieved voice was in Jane&rsquo;s
ears as she unhung the receiver and gave the number.
She supposed that Henry still lived with his mother,
and that Mrs. March would still keep an indignant
bridge table waiting whilst she discoursed upon Henry&mdash;his
faults, his foibles, his ailments, and his prospects
of inheriting Luttrell Marches.</p>
<p>At that moment Henry, appropriately enough, was
gazing at a photograph of Jane. It must not be
imagined that this was a habit of his. Three years ago
was three years ago, and Jane had receded into the
distance with a great many other pleasant things.
But to-night he had been looking through some old
snapshots, and all of a sudden there was that three-years-old
Cornish holiday, and Jane. Henry sat frowning
at the photograph.</p>
<p>Jane&mdash;why was one fond of Jane? He wondered
where she was. It was only last week that some one had
mentioned old Carruthers, and had seemed surprised
that Henry did not know how long he had been dead.</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang, and Henry jumped up with
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said a voice&mdash;and &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Captain March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jane Smith,&rdquo; said the voice, and Henry very
nearly dropped the receiver. There was a pause, and
then Jane said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to come and see you on business. Can you
spare the time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; said Henry, and he heard
her say, &ldquo;Thank goodness,&rdquo; with much sincerity.
The next moment she was apologising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Henry, that sounded awfully rude, but
I really do want to see you about something very
important. No, you can&rsquo;t come and see me. I&rsquo;m one
of the great unemployed, and I&rsquo;m not living anywhere
at present. No, I won&rsquo;t meet you at a restaurant
either. Just tell me your nearest Tube Station, and I&rsquo;ll
come along. All right then; I won&rsquo;t be more than ten
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry turned away, feeling a little dazed. Being a
methodical young man, he proceeded to put away the
photographs with which the table was littered. A
little snapshot of Jane he kept to the last, and ended
by not putting it away at all. After he had looked at
it for some time, he put it on the mantelpiece behind
the clock. The hands pointed to nine o&rsquo;clock precisely.
Then he looked at himself in the glass that
was over the mantel, and straightened his tie.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s mother naturally considered him the most
beautiful of created beings. Without going quite as
far as this, Henry certainly approved of his own looks.
Having approved of himself, he proceeded to move the
clock back half an inch, and to alter the position of the
twisted candlesticks on either side of it. Then he
poked the fire. Then he began to walk up and down
the room. And then the bell rang.</p>
<p>Henry went out into the hall and opened the door
of the flat, and there on the threshold stood Jane in a
shabby blue serge coat and skirt, with an old black felt
hat. Not pretty, not smart&mdash;just Jane. She walked
in and gave him her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Henry!&rdquo; she said. Then she laughed.
&ldquo;Or, do I call you Captain March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call me Henry,&rdquo; said Henry, and he shut the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;d like to come into the drawing-room&rdquo;&mdash;this
came hurriedly after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
He moved across the hall, switched on the light, and
stood aside for her to pass. Jane looked in and saw
more pink cushions and pink lamp-shades than she
would have believed it possible to get into one small
room. There were also a great many pink roses, and
the air was heavy with scent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not where you see people on
business,&rdquo; said Jane, and Henry led the way into the
dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my room,&rdquo; he said, and Jane sat down on
a straight, high-backed chair and leaned her elbows
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Henry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come here to tell
you a story, and I want you to sit down and listen to
it; and please forget that you are you, and that I am
I. Just listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry sat down obediently. It was so good to see
Jane again that, if she liked to sit there and talk till
midnight, he had no objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now attend,&rdquo; said Jane, and she began her story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there were twin sisters, and
they were called Renata and Jane Carruthers. They
had a cousin James&mdash;you remember him&mdash;my darling
Jimmy? Jimmy wanted to marry Renata, but she
refused him and married John Smith, my father, and
when I was five years old she and my father both died,
and Jimmy adopted me. Now we come to the other
twin. Her name was Jane, and she ran away to
America with a sort of anarchist Irishman named
Molloy. She died young, and she left one daughter,
whom she called Renata Jane. I, by the bye, am Jane
Renata. The twin sisters were so much alike that no
one ever knew them apart. Jimmy had photographs
of them, and even he could never tell me which was
my mother and which was my Aunt Jane. Now, Henry,
listen to this. My Cousin Renata is in London, and
it seems that she and I are just as much alike as our
mothers were. In fact, it&rsquo;s because Renata&rsquo;s young
man took me for Renata this afternoon that I am here,
asking your advice, at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry smiled a somewhat puzzled smile. &ldquo;Have
you asked my advice?&rdquo; he said; but Jane did not
smile. Instead, she leaned forward a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still at Scotland Yard, Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminal Investigation Department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen. Renata is in what her young man
calls &lsquo;a position of deadly peril.&rsquo; In more ordinary
language, she&rsquo;s in a nasty hole. Do you know anything
about Cornelius Molloy? That&rsquo;s the Anarchist Uncle,
Renata&rsquo;s father, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any anarchists nowadays,&rdquo; said
Henry meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was brought up on anarchists, and I don&rsquo;t see
that it matters what you call them,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;&lsquo;A&rsquo;
for Anarchist, &lsquo;B&rsquo; for Bolshevik, and so on. The
point is, do you know anything about Molloy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him,&rdquo; Henry admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing good?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t hear much that&rsquo;s good about people&mdash;officially,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Arnold Todhunter says that Renata is
supposed to have overheard something&mdash;something
that her father&rsquo;s associates think so important that
they&rsquo;re keeping her under lock and key, and seriously
contemplating putting her out of the way altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she overhear anything?&rdquo; asked Henry, just
as Jane had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows except Renata, and she won&rsquo;t tell.
Molloy goes back to the States to-morrow. They
won&rsquo;t let him take Renata with him, and Arnold
Todhunter wants to marry her and carry her off to
Bolivia, where he&rsquo;s got an engineering job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That appears to be a good scheme,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you see they&rsquo;ll never let her go so long
as they are not sure how much she knows. Arnold
says she was walking in her sleep, and blundered in
on about twenty-five of them, all talking the most
deadly secrets. And they don&rsquo;t know when she woke
or what she heard. And&rdquo;&mdash;Jane&rsquo;s eyes began
to dance a little&mdash;&ldquo;Arnold has a perfectly splendid
idea. He takes Renata to Bolivia, and I take Renata&rsquo;s
place. Nobody knows she has gone, so nobody looks
for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense,&rdquo; said Henry; then&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this Todhunter like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mug,&rdquo; said Jane briefly. She paused, and then
went on in a different voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, who is at Luttrell Marches now? Did
your Cousin Tony ever turn up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Jane, with perfect simplicity,
&ldquo;Renata is to be sent down to Luttrell Marches to-morrow,
and somebody there&mdash;somebody, Henry&mdash;will
decide whether she is to be eliminated or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry sat perfectly silent. He stared at Jane, and
she stared at him. It seemed as if the silence in the
room were growing heavier and heavier, like water
that gathers behind some unseen dam. All of a
sudden Henry sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a hoax?&rdquo; he asked, in tones of such anger
that Jane hardly recognised them.</p>
<p>Jane got up too. The hand that she rested upon
the table was not quite steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, how dare you?&rdquo; and her voice shook a
little too.</p>
<p>Henry swung round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;I beg your pardon, Jane, for the Lord&rsquo;s
sake don&rsquo;t look at me like that. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s
pretty staggering to have you come here and say....&rdquo;
He paused. &ldquo;What was it you wanted to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you who is living at Luttrell Marches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Henry was silent. He walked to the end of the
room and back. Jane&rsquo;s eyes followed him. Where
had this sudden wave of emotion come from? It
seemed to be eddying about them, filling the confined
space. Jane made herself look away from Henry,
forced herself to notice the room, the furniture, the
pictures&mdash;anything that was commonplace and
ordinary. This was decidedly Henry&rsquo;s room and not
his mother&rsquo;s, from the worn leather chairs and plain
oak table to the neutral coloured walls with their half-dozen
Meissonier engravings. Not a flower, not a
trifle of any sort, and one wall all books from ceiling
to floor. Exactly opposite to Jane there was a fine
print of &ldquo;The Generals in the Snow.&rdquo; The lowering,
thunderous sky, heavy with snow and black with the
omens of Napoleon&rsquo;s fall, dominated the picture, the
room. Jane looked at it, and looked away with a
shiver, and as she did so, Henry was speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, I don&rsquo;t want to answer that question for a
minute or two. I want to think. I want a little time
to turn things over in my mind. Look here, come
round to the fire and sit down comfortably. Let&rsquo;s
talk about something else for a bit. I want all your
news, for one thing. Tell me what you&rsquo;ve been doing
with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane came slowly to the fireside. After all, it was
pleasant just to put everything on one side, and be
comfortable. Henry&rsquo;s chair was very comfortable, and
the day seemed to have lasted for weeks, and weeks,
and weeks. She put out her hands to the fire, and
then, because she noticed that they were still trembling
a little, she folded them in her lap. Henry leaned
against the mantelpiece and looked down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that summer at Upwater&mdash;you know we were
lodging with the woman who had the post office&mdash;Jimmy
and I stayed on after all the other visitors were
gone. I expect it was rather irregular, but I used to
help her. You see her son didn&rsquo;t get back until
eighteen months after the armistice, and she wasn&rsquo;t
really up to the work. In the end, you may say I ran
that post office. I did it very well, too. It was something
to do, especially after Jimmy died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard. I wondered where you were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed on until the son came home, and then I
couldn&rsquo;t. He was awful, and she thought him quite
perfect, poor old soul. I came to London and got a
job in an office, and a month ago I lost it. The firm
was cutting down expenses, like everybody else. And
then&mdash;well, I looked for another job, and couldn&rsquo;t find
one, and this morning my landlady locked the door in
my face and kept my box. And that, Henry, is why I
am thinking seriously of changing places with my
Cousin Renata, who, at least, has a roof over her head
and enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; said Henry furiously, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean
to say&mdash;so that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re looking such a white
rag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane was horrified to find that her eyes had filled
with tears. She laughed, but the laugh was not a very
convincing one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did have a cup of coffee and two penny buns,&rdquo;
she began; and then Henry was fetching sandwiches
from the sideboard and pressing a cup of hot chocolate
into her not unwilling hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They leave this awful stuff over a spirit lamp for
my mother, and she always has sandwiches when she
comes in. It&rsquo;s better than nothing,&rdquo; he added in
tones of wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not awful,&rdquo; protested Jane; but Henry was
not mollified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why are you so
hard up? Didn&rsquo;t Mr. Carruthers provide for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s colour rose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t much, and what he had was an annuity.
You know what Jimmy was, and how he forgot things.
I am really quite sure that he had forgotten about
its being an annuity, and that he thought that I should
be quite comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry swallowed his opinion of Mr. Carruthers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he your only relation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jane, who was beginning to feel better,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t really count Cousin Louisa; she was only
Jimmy&rsquo;s half-sister, and that makes her a sort of third
half-cousin of my mother&rsquo;s. Besides, she always
simply loathed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve no other relations at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the Anarchist Uncle,&rdquo; said Jane brightly.
She gave him her cup and plate. &ldquo;Your mother has
simply lovely sandwiches, Henry. Thank you ever so
much for them, but what will she do when she comes
home and finds I have eaten them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Henry&rsquo;s tone was very
short. &ldquo;Look here, Jane, you must let&mdash;er, er, I
mean, won&rsquo;t you let....&rdquo; He stuck, and Jane looked
at him very kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Henry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s frightfully
nice of you, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence. When Jane thought it had
lasted long enough, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see, it all comes back again to Renata.
Have you done your thinking, Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Henry. He drew a chair to the table
and sat down half turned to the fire&mdash;half turned to
Jane. Sometimes he looked at her, but oftener his gaze
dwelt intently on the rise and fall of the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that your cousin is to be
taken to Luttrell Marches? Did these people tell her
so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane&mdash;&ldquo;of course not. As far as I can
make out from Arnold Todhunter, Renata is locked in
her room, but there&rsquo;s another key and she can get in
and out. She can move about inside the flat, but she
can&rsquo;t get out of it. Well, one night she crept out and
listened, though you would have thought she had had
enough of listening, and she heard them say that, as
soon as her father was out of the way, they would send
her to Luttrell Marches and let &lsquo;Number One&rsquo; decide
whether she was to be &lsquo;eliminated.&rsquo; Since then she&rsquo;s
been nearly off her head with terror, poor kid. Now,
Henry, it&rsquo;s your turn. What about Luttrell Marches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s face seemed to have grown rigid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
impossible,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>The clock above them struck ten, and he waited till
the last stroke had died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know quite what to say to you, but whatever
I say is confidential. You&rsquo;ve heard my mother
talk of the Luttrells, and you may or may not know
that my uncle died a year ago. You have also probably
heard that his son, my Cousin Anthony, disappeared
into the blue in 1915.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Luttrell Marches belongs to you?&rdquo; For
the life of her, Jane could not keep a little consternation
out of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. If Tony had been missing for seven years, I
could apply for leave to presume his death, but there&rsquo;s
another year to run. My mother&mdash;every one&mdash;supposes
that I am only waiting until the time is up.
As a matter of fact&mdash;Jane, I&rsquo;m telling you what I
haven&rsquo;t told my mother&mdash;Anthony Luttrell is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. And you must please forget what
I have told you&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you have to remember it,&rdquo; said Henry in an
odd voice. &ldquo;For the rest, Luttrell Marches was let
during my uncle&rsquo;s lifetime to Sir William Carr-Magnus.
You know who I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The</i> Sir William Carr-Magnus?&rdquo; said Jane, and
Henry nodded.</p>
<p>Jane felt absolutely dazed. Sir William Carr-Magnus,
the great chemist, great philanthropist, and
Government expert!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is engaged,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;on a series of most
important investigations and experiments which he is
conducting on behalf of the Government. The extreme
seclusion of Luttrell Marches, and the lonely country
all round are, of course, exactly what is required under
the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite suddenly Jane began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all mad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve quite made up
my mind. Renata shall elope, and I will go to Luttrell
Marches. It will be better than the workhouse anyhow.
You know, Henry, seriously, I have a lot of
qualifications for being a sleuth. Jimmy taught me
simply heaps of languages, I&rsquo;ve got eyes like gimlets,
and I can do lip-reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can. Jimmy had a perfectly deaf housekeeper,
and it worried him to hear us shouting at each
other, so I had her taught, and learned myself for
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry crossed to the bookcase and came back with a
photograph album in his hand. Taking a loose card
from between the pages, he put it down in front of
Jane, saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;There you may as well make your host&rsquo;s acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked long at the face which was sufficiently
well known to the public. The massive head, the
great brow with eyes set very deep beneath shaggy
tufts of hair, the rather hard mouth&mdash;all these were
already familiar to her, and yet she looked long. After
a few moments&rsquo; hesitation, Henry put a second photograph
upon the top of the first, and this time Jane
caught her breath. It was the picture of a woman in
evening dress. The neck and shoulders were like
those of a statue, beautiful and, as it were, rigid. But
it was the beauty of the face that took Jane&rsquo;s breath
away&mdash;that and a certain look in the eyes. The word
hungry came into her mind and stayed there. A
woman with proud lips and hungry eyes, and the most
beautiful face in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raymond Carr-Magnus. She is Lady Heritage,
and a widow now&mdash;Sir William&rsquo;s only child. He
gave her a boy&rsquo;s name and a boy&rsquo;s education&mdash;brought
her up to take his place, and found himself with a
lovely woman on his hands. This was done from
Amory&rsquo;s portrait of her in 1915&mdash;the year of her
marriage. She was at one time engaged to my
Cousin Anthony. If you do go to Luttrell Marches,
you will see her, for she makes her home with
Sir William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s voice was perfectly expressionless. The
short sentences followed one another with a little
pause after each. Jane looked sideways, and said very
quick and low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you very fond of her, Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>And when she had said it, her heart beat and her
hands gripped one another.</p>
<p>Henry took the photograph from her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said she was engaged to Tony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Henry, but were you fond of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound you, Jane. Yes, I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane rose to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have an assignation
with Arnold Todhunter, who is going to take me
up a fire-escape and substitute me for Renata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry took out a pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me Molloy&rsquo;s address, please?&rdquo; And
when she had given it: &ldquo;You know, my good girl,
there&rsquo;s nothing on earth to prevent my having that
flat raided and your cousin&rsquo;s deposition taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; said Jane&mdash;&ldquo;only then nobody
will go down to Luttrell Marches and find out what&rsquo;s
going on there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked straight at Henry as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, whatever you say, and whatever you
do, and I only came to you because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seemed so sort of lonesome going off into
situations of deadly peril with no one taking the very
slightest interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s voice shook absurdly on the last word. And
in an instant Henry had his arm round her and was
saying, &ldquo;Jane&mdash;Jane&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t go, you shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane stepped back. Her eyes blazed. &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>She tried to say it icily, but she could not steady her
voice. Henry&rsquo;s arm felt solid and comfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll let you,&rdquo; said Henry
very loud, and upon that the door opened and there
entered Mrs. de Luttrelle March, larger, pinker, and
more horrified than Jane had ever seen her. She, for
her part, beheld Henry, his arms about a shabby
girl, and her horror reached its climax when she
recognised the girl as &ldquo;that dreadfully designing
Jane Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she gasped&mdash;&ldquo;oh, Henry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane released herself with a jerk, and Mrs. de Luttrelle
March sat down in the nearest chair and burst
into a flood of tears. Her purple satin opera cloak fell
away, disclosing a peach-coloured garment that clung
to her plump contours and seemed calculated rather for
purposes of revelation than concealment. Large tears
rolled down her powdered cheeks, and she sought in
vain for a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think it of you&mdash;at least not here,
not under my very roof. And if you were going to
break my heart like your father, it would have been
kinder to do it ten years ago, because then I should
have known what to expect, and anyhow, I should
probably have been dead by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sniffed and made a desperate gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Henry, I can&rsquo;t find it! Haven&rsquo;t you got one,
or don&rsquo;t you care whether my heart&rsquo;s broken? And I
haven&rsquo;t even got a handkerchief to cry with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry produced a handkerchief and gave it to her
without attempting to speak. Years of experience
had taught him that to stay his mother&rsquo;s first flood of
words was an impossibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Jane felt rather sick. Mrs. March was so very large
and pink, and the whole affair so very undignified, that
her one overmastering desire was to get away. She
heard Henry&rsquo;s &ldquo;This is Miss Smith, Mother. She
came to see me on business&rdquo;; and then Mrs. March&rsquo;s
wail, &ldquo;Your father always called it business too, and
I didn&rsquo;t think&mdash;no, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d bring a girl
in here when my back was turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane stood up very straight, but Henry had taken
her hand again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, in a very low voice.
&ldquo;She&mdash;she had a rotten time when she was young&rdquo;;
then, in a tone that cut through Mrs. March&rsquo;s sobs
as an east wind cuts the rain, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear mother, you are making some extra-ordinary
mistake. The last time that I saw Miss Smith
was three years ago. I then asked her to marry me,
and she refused. I would go on asking her every day
from now to kingdom come if I thought that it was the
slightest good. As it isn&rsquo;t, I am only anxious to be of
use to her in any possible way. She came here to-night
to ask my advice on an official matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March fixed her very large blue eyes upon her
son. They were swimming with tears, but behind the
tears there was something which suddenly went to
Jane&rsquo;s heart&mdash;something bewildered and hurt, and
rather ungrown-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always were a good boy, Henry,&rdquo; said Mrs.
March, and Henry&rsquo;s instant rigid embarrassment had
the effect of cheering Jane. She came forward and
took the limp white hand that still clutched a borrowed
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll always be a good son to you, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t take him away from you for the world. He&rsquo;s
just a very kind friend. Good-night, Mrs. March.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>She went out without looking back, but Henry followed
her into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not really going to plunge into this foolish
affair?&rdquo; he said as they stood for a moment by the
door. It was Jane who opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, Henry. You can&rsquo;t stop me, and you
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes looked straight into his, and Henry did
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. Read the agony column in <i>The
Times</i>. If I want you to have a message, it will be
there, signed with the day of the week on which it
appears. You understand? If the message is in
<i>The Times</i> of Wednesday, it will be signed, &lsquo;Wednesday.&rsquo;
And if there are directions in the message, you
will obey them implicitly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>thrilling</i>,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry looked very tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve done right, but I can&rsquo;t tell
you any more just now. By the way, Molloy&rsquo;s flat will
be watched, and I shall know whether you go to
Luttrell Marches or not. Good-bye, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry watched the lift disappear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Arnold Todhunter, &ldquo;is the fire-escape.&rdquo;
His tone was that of one who says,
&ldquo;This is our Rembrandt.&rdquo; Proud proprietorship pervaded
his entire atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>They stood together in a small back-yard. It seemed
to be quite full of things like barrows, paving-stones,
old tin cans, and broken crockery. Jane had already
tripped over a meat tin and collided with two chicken
coops and a dog kennel. She reflected that this
was just the sort of back-yard Arnold would
find.</p>
<p>Everything was very dark. The blackest shadow
of all marked the wall that they were to climb. Here
and there a lighted window showed, and Jane could
see that these windows had rounded parapets jutting
out on a level with the sill.</p>
<p>Arnold, meanwhile, was tugging at something which
seemed to be a short plank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall need it. I&rsquo;d better go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And forthwith he began to climb, clutching the
plank with one hand and the iron ladder with the
other.</p>
<p>Jane let him get a good start, and followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The ladder was quite easy to climb; it was only
when one thought of how immensely far away the
skyline had looked, that it seemed as if it would be
very uncomfortable to look down instead of up, and to
see that horrid little yard equally far below.</p>
<p>Jane did look down once, and everything was black
and blurred and shadowy. It was odd to be clinging to
the side of a house, with the dark all round one, and
the steady roar of the London traffic dulled almost to
nothingness.</p>
<p>The night was very still, and a little cold. Somewhere
below amongst the tin cans a cat said,
&ldquo;Grrrwoosh,&rdquo; not loud, but on a softly inquiring note.
The inquiry was instantly answered by a long, piercing
wail which travelled rapidly over four octaves, and
then dwelt with soulful intensity upon an agonising
top note.</p>
<p>With a muttered exclamation, Arnold Todhunter
dropped his plank. It grazed Jane&rsquo;s shoulder, and
fell among the cats and crockery with a most appalling
clatter.</p>
<p>Jane shut her eyes, gripped the ladder desperately,
and wondered whether she would fall first and be
arrested afterwards, or the other way about. Nothing
happened. Apparently the neighbourhood was inured
to the bombardment of cats.</p>
<p>After a moment Jane became aware of Arnold&rsquo;s
boots in close proximity to her head. A wave of fury
swept away her giddiness, and she began to descend
with a rapidity which surprised herself.</p>
<p>Once more they stood in the yard.</p>
<p>Once more Arnold groped for his plank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up first,&rdquo; said Jane, in a low tone of
rage. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be guillotined on a public fire-escape.
Which floor is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;The top,&rdquo; said Arnold sulkily, and without more
ado Jane went up the ladder.</p>
<p>It was exactly like a rather horrid dream. The
ladder was very cold and very gritty, and you climbed,
and climbed, and went on climbing without arriving
anywhere.</p>
<p>Pictures of the Eiffel Tower and New York skyscrapers
flitted through Jane&rsquo;s mind. She also remembered
interesting paragraphs about how many million
pennies placed on end would reach to the moon. And
at long, long last the escape ended at a window-sill
with a parapet-enclosed space beneath it.</p>
<p>Jane sat down on the window-sill and shut her eyes
tight. She had a horrid feeling that the building was
rocking a little. After a moment Arnold crawled
over the edge of the coping, dragging his plank. He
was panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, with his mouth close to Jane&rsquo;s
ear&mdash;&ldquo;this window only leads to the landing where the
lift shaft ends. We&rsquo;ve got to get across to the next
one, which is inside Molloy&rsquo;s flat. That&rsquo;s what the
plank is for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blowing down my neck,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>Arnold Todhunter felt that he had never met a
girl whom he disliked so much. Extraordinary
that she should look so like Renata and be so
different.</p>
<p>He knelt just inside the parapet, and pushed the
board slowly out into the dark until it rested on the
parapet of the next window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go first, or shall I?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Jane felt sure that, if she had to watch Arnold
balancing on that plank miles above the ground, she
would never be able to cross it herself.</p>
<p>The reflection that it was Renata, and not she, who
would have to make the descent fortified her considerably.
Even so, she never quite knew how she
crossed to the other window. It was an affair of
clenched teeth and a mind that shut out resolutely
everything except the next groping clutch of the
hand&mdash;the next carefully taken step.</p>
<p>She sank against the window-sill and heard Arnold
follow her. Just at the end he slipped; he seemed to
change his feet, and then with a heavy thud pitched
down on the top of Jane.</p>
<p>She thought he said &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; and she was quite
sure that she said &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an awful moment while they listened for
the fall of the plank, but it held to the coping by a
bare half-inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness I&rsquo;m not Renata!&rdquo; said Jane, with
heartfelt sincerity. And&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; returned Mr. Todhunter,
with equal fervour, and at that moment the
window opened.</p>
<p>There was a little sobbing gasp, and a girl was clinging
to Arnold Todhunter and whispering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling&mdash;darling, I thought you&rsquo;d never come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold crawled through the open window, and from
the pitch-black hall there came the sounds of demonstrative
affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious me, there&rsquo;s no accounting for
tastes!&rdquo; said Jane, under her breath. And she too
climbed down into the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Arnold appeared to be trying to explain Jane to
Renata, whilst Renata alternated between sobs and
kisses.</p>
<p>Jane lost her temper, suddenly and completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, you two, come where there&rsquo;s a
light, and where we can talk sense. Every minute you
waste is just asking for trouble. What&rsquo;s that room
with the light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult to be impressive in a low whisper, but
Renata did stop kissing Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bedroom,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be
locked in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane groped in the dark and got Renata by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along in there and talk to me. We&rsquo;ve got to
talk. Arnold can wait outside the window. I don&rsquo;t
want him in the least. You&rsquo;re going to spend the rest
of your life with him in Bolivia, so you needn&rsquo;t worry.
I simply won&rsquo;t have him whilst we are talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold loathed Jane a little more, but Renata
allowed herself to be detached from him with a sob.</p>
<p>Inside the lighted bedroom the two girls looked at
one another in an amazed silence.</p>
<p>In height and contour, feature and colouring, the
likeness was without a flaw.</p>
<p>Facing them was a small wardrobe of painted wood.
A narrow panel of looking-glass formed the door. The
two figures were reflected in it, and Jane, tossing her
hat on to the bed, studied them there with a long, careful
scrutiny.</p>
<p>The same brown hair, growing in the same odd peak
upon the forehead, the same arch to the brow, the same
greenish-hazel eyes. Renata&rsquo;s face was tear-stained,
her eyelids red and swollen&mdash;&ldquo;but that&rsquo;s exactly how I
look when I cry,&rdquo; said Jane. She set her hand by
Renata&rsquo;s hand, her foot by Renata&rsquo;s foot. The same
to a shade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The other girl watched her with bewildered eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak&mdash;say something,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;the multiplication table, the days of
the week&mdash;I want to hear your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jane, what an odd girl you are!&rdquo; said Renata&mdash;&ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t you think Arnold had better come in?
It must be awfully cold out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to tell,
but I believe that our voices are as much alike as the
rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her bag, and took out The List and a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, write something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renata wrote her own name, and then, after a
pause, &ldquo;It is a fine day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite like,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;but nearly all girls do
write the same hand now. I can manage that. Now,
tell me, where were you at school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bazing&rsquo;s, Ilfracombe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since I was five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere else out of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What languages do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;French&mdash;I&rsquo;m not good at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that. Now, Arnold tells me you heard
them say you were to go to Luttrell Marches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renata looked terrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to know? They haven&rsquo;t told
you officially?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, they haven&rsquo;t told me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father goes away to-morrow. Have they
told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; said Renata, bursting into
tears. &ldquo;Oh, Jane, you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like!&mdash;to
be locked in here&mdash;to have them come and ask questions
until I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying&mdash;and to know,
to know all the time that if I make one slip I&rsquo;m lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, but it&rsquo;s going to be all right,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; sobbed Renata, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t eat.&rdquo;
She held up her wrist and looked at it with interest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got ever so much thinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane could have slapped her. She reflected with
thankfulness that Bolivia was a good long way off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you talk about
&lsquo;they&rsquo;&mdash;who are &lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man in a fur coat,&rdquo; faltered Renata&mdash;&ldquo;that
is to say, he generally has on a fur coat; he
always seems to be cold. He&rsquo;s the worst; I don&rsquo;t
know his name, but they call him Number Two.
He&rsquo;s English. Then there&rsquo;s Number Four. He&rsquo;s a
foreigner of some sort, and he&rsquo;s dreadful&mdash;dreadful.
I think&mdash;I think&rdquo;&mdash;her voice dropped to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;my
father is Number Three.&rdquo; Then almost inaudibly,
&ldquo;Number One is at Luttrell Marches. It&rsquo;s Number
One who will decide about me&mdash;about me. Oh, Jane,
I&rsquo;m so dreadfully frightened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renata&rsquo;s eyes, wide and terrified, stared past Jane
into vacancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be in the least frightened; you&rsquo;re
going to Bolivia,&rdquo; said Jane briskly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell some one,&rdquo; said Renata, still in that
whispering voice&mdash;still staring. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell them,
I wouldn&rsquo;t tell them, but I must tell some one. Jane,
I must tell you what I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quick as lightning Jane put her hand over the other
girl&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she said, and in the pause that followed
two things stood out in her mind clear and sharp. If
Renata told her secret, Jane&rsquo;s danger would be doubled.
If Renata did not tell it, the crime these men were
planning might ripen undisturbed. Jane had a high
courage, but she hesitated.</p>
<p>Her hand dropped slowly to her side. She saw
Renata&rsquo;s mouth open protestingly, and there came on
her a wild impulse to stave things off, to have time,
just a little time before she let that secret in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to change clothes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Quick,
give me that skirt and take mine. Yes, put on the
coat, and I&rsquo;ll give you my shoes, too. My hat&rsquo;s on the
bed; you&rsquo;d better put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renata obeyed. A resentful feeling of being hustled,
ordered about, treated like a child, was upon her; but
Jane moved and spoke so quickly, and seemed so sure
of herself, that there seemed no opening for protest.
She thought Jane&rsquo;s blue serge shabby and old fashioned&mdash;not
nearly as nice as her own&mdash;and Jane&rsquo;s shoes
were terribly worn and needed mending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, listen,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Arnold likes to go to my rooms and pay up two
weeks&rsquo; rent, he can get my box and all my other
clothes for you. There&rsquo;s not very much, but it&rsquo;ll be
better than nothing. I&rsquo;ll write a line for him to take,
and put the address on it. And will you please remember
now and from henceforth that you are Jane Renata
Smith, and not Renata Jane Molloy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Jane was scribbling a couple of lines as she spoke,
and as she turned and gave the paper into Renata&rsquo;s
hand, she knew that she must decide now. The
moment of grace was up, and whether she bade Renata
speak or be silent, there could be no drawing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you going to tell me?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Renata stood silent for a long minute. She was
twisting and turning the slip of paper which Jane
had given her. She looked down at her twisting
fingers; her breath began to come more quickly. Then
with great suddenness she pushed the note into her
pocket, and caught at Jane with both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must tell you&mdash;I must. It will be coming
nearer all the time, and I must tell some one, or I shall
go mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;You were walking
in your sleep, and you opened the door and heard&mdash;what
did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes were bright and steady, her face set.
She had taken her decision, and her courage rose to
meet an unknown shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was walking in my sleep,&rdquo; repeated Renata, in
a low, faltering voice, &ldquo;and I opened the door, and I
heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a screen in front of me, and just beyond
the screen a man talking. I heard&mdash;oh, Jane, I heard
every single word he said! I can&rsquo;t forget one of them&mdash;if
I could, if I only could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hear?&rdquo; said Jane firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Renata&rsquo;s grip became desperate. She leant forward
until her lips touched Jane&rsquo;s ear. In a voice that was
only a breath, she gave word for word, sentence by
sentence, the speech in which Number Four had proclaimed
the death sentence of the civilised world. It was
just a bald transcript like the whisper of a phonograph
record, as if the words and sentences had been stamped
on an inanimate plate by some recording machinery, to
be released again with utter regularity and correctness.</p>
<p>Every vestige of colour left Jane&rsquo;s face as she
listened. Only her eyes remained bright and steady.
Something seemed to knock at her heart. Renata&rsquo;s
last mechanical repetition died away, and with a sob
of relief she flung her arms round Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jane, I do hope they won&rsquo;t kill you! Oh, I
do hope they won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>She detached herself from Renata, and as she did
so, both girls heard the same thing&mdash;from beyond the
two closed doors the groan and grind of the lift
machinery in motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come back,&rdquo; said Renata, in a whisper
of terror.</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s hand was on the electric-light switch before
the words had left Renata&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>As darkness sprang upon the room she had the door
open. Her grip was on Renata&rsquo;s wrist, her arm about
Renata&rsquo;s waist, and they were in the hall. It seemed
pitch black at first, with a gloom that pressed upon
their eyes and confused the sense of direction.</p>
<p>The lift rose with a steady rumble.</p>
<p>Then, as Jane stared before her, the oblong of the
window sprang into view. She took a step forward
and felt Renata&rsquo;s head against her shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to faint,&rdquo; came in a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll never see Arnold again. Do you want
to be caught like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane dragged her on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata, you rabbit!&mdash;if they don&rsquo;t kill you, I will.
Faint in Bolivia as much as you like, but I forbid you
to do it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s arm felt the weight of a limp, sagging figure,
but they had reached the window. From the sill
Arnold bent, listening anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; gasped Jane.</p>
<p>And, as his arm relieved the strain, she pinched
Renata with all her might. There was a sob&mdash;a gasp&mdash;Arnold
lifted, Jane pushed, and somehow the thing was
done. Arnold and Renata were outside, crouched down
between the parapet and the window, whilst Jane
leaned panting against the jamb.</p>
<p>As the lift stopped with a jerk, her rigid fingers drew
the window down and fastened it. Now, horribly loud,
the clang of the iron gate. Steps outside&mdash;voices&mdash;the
grate of a key in the lock.</p>
<p>Jane knew now what Renata had felt. Easy, so easy
to yield to this paralysis of terror, and to stand rooted
there until they came! With all her might she pushed
the temptation from her and roused to action.</p>
<p>Thank Heaven, she had had no time to put on
Renata&rsquo;s shoes!</p>
<p>After the first movement strength and swiftness
came to her. She was across the hall without a sound.
The bedroom door closed upon her. As it did so, the
door of the flat swung wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span></h2>
<p>Jane stood in the dark, her hand upon the door
knob. Slowly, very slowly, she released it. As she
leaned there, her head almost touching the panelling,
she could hear two men talking in the hall beyond.
They spoke in English, but only the outer sound of the
words came to her.</p>
<p>With an immense effort she straightened herself,
and was about to move away when a thought struck
her like a knife-blow&mdash;the key&mdash;the second tell-tale
key&mdash;if she had forgotten it!</p>
<p>Her hand slid back, touched the cold key, turned
and withdrew it, moving with a steady firmness that
surprised herself.</p>
<p>Then she made a half-turn and tried to visualise the
room as she had seen it in the light.</p>
<p>Immediately opposite, the cupboard with the looking-glass
panel. The window in the right-hand wall, and
the bed between window and cupboard. At the foot
of the bed a chair, and on the same side as the
window a chest of drawers with a looking-glass upon it
and Renata&rsquo;s plain schoolgirlish brush and comb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>When she had placed everything, Jane began to
move forward in the direction of the window. Her
left hand touched the rail of the bed-foot, her right,
groping, brushed the counterpane and rested on something
oddly familiar. Her heart gave a sudden jerk,
for this was her own bag, which Renata should have
taken. She opened it with quick, trembling fingers,
took out her handkerchief, and then stuffed the bag
right down inside the bed.</p>
<p>A couple of steps brought her to the window, and she
pressed closely to it, listening, and wished she dared to
open it. There was no sound from outside. She
leaned her forehead against the glass, and wondered
how many years had passed since the morning. It
seemed impossible for this day to come to an end.</p>
<p>Then quite suddenly a key turned in the lock, and
the door opened, not widely, but as one opens the door
of a room where some one is asleep. A man&rsquo;s head was
silhouetted against the hall light. Part of his shoulder
showed in a dark overcoat.</p>
<p>He spoke, and a hint of brogue beneath a good deal
of American twang informed Jane that this was her
official father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you awake, Renata?&rdquo;&mdash;and, as he asked the
question, a second man came up behind him and stood
there listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, muffling her voice with her handkerchief.</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-night to you&rdquo;&mdash;and the other man,
speaking over his shoulder, said in an easy, cultivated
voice without any accent at all:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant dreams, Miss Renata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; was just audible and no more,
but obviously it satisfied the two men, for the door was
shut, the key turned and withdrawn, and presently the
hall light went out, and the darkness was absolute and
unrelieved, except where the midnight sky showed
just less black than the interior of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>After what seemed a long, long time, Jane undressed
and got to bed. It was strange to grope for and find
Renata&rsquo;s neatly folded nightdress.</p>
<p>Presently she lay down, and presently she slept.
Time ceased; the day was over.</p>
<p>She woke suddenly a few hours later. It was still
dark. She came broad awake at once, and sat up in
bed as if some one had called to her. Her mind was
full of one horrifying thought.</p>
<p>The plank&mdash;what had Arnold done with the plank?</p>
<p>Impossible that he should have helped Renata down
the fire-escape and carried the plank as well, and somehow
Jane did not see Arnold troubling to come back
for it.</p>
<p>One thing was certain; if Arnold had left the plank
in its compromising position, it must be removed before
daylight.</p>
<p>Jane got out of bed, shivering. She went to the
window, opened it, and leaned out. The yard, mews,
wall, and parapet&mdash;all were veiled in the same thick
dusk. She strained her eyes, but it was impossible to
distinguish anything. There was nothing for it but to
cross that horrid little hall again, open the window, and
make sure.</p>
<p>With the key in her hand, and mingled rage and
terror in her heart, she felt her way to the door, opened
it noiselessly, and crossed barefoot to the window.
The hasp was stiff, it creaked, and the window stuck.</p>
<p>Recklessness took possession of Jane. With a jerk
she pushed it up; as it chanced, recklessness made less
noise than caution would have done. She leaned
right out, and there, sure enough, was the plank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Even Jane&rsquo;s anger could provide her with nothing
more cutting than, &ldquo;How exactly like Arnold Todhunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood quite still and considered.</p>
<p>A bold course was the only one. Remembering the
plank&rsquo;s previous fall and the perfect calm with which
the neighbourhood had received it, she decided to take
the same chance again&mdash;only, she must be quick and
have it all planned in her head: first a shove to the
plank, then down with the window and latch it, five
steps&mdash;no, six&mdash;across the hall, and then her own door,
and on no account must she forget the key.</p>
<p>She drew a long breath, leaned out, and pushed. The
board was heavier than she had supposed&mdash;harder to
move. She had to pull it in, until the sudden weight
and strain told her that it was clear of the coping upon
which the farther end had rested. Then she pushed
with all her might, and as it fell, her hands were on the
window quick and steady. Next moment she was
crouching in Renata&rsquo;s bed, the clothes clutched about
her, the door key cold in her palm. She pushed it
far down beneath the clothes, and sat breathless&mdash;listening.</p>
<p>The crash with which the plank had landed seemed
to have deafened her, but as the vibrations died away,
she heard, sharp and unmistakable, the click of a latch
and hurrying footsteps.</p>
<p>The next moment her door was opened and her light
switched on. Quick as thought her hand was over
her eyes and the sheet up to her chin.</p>
<p>Molloy stood in the doorway, and beyond him the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing? Did you hear it?&rdquo; he stammered,
and then the other man pushed him aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a look from your window if you&rsquo;ll excuse
me, Miss Renata,&rdquo; he said, and crossed the room.</p>
<p>As he leaned out, Jane watched him from beneath
her hand, and recalled Renata&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;He generally
wears a fur coat; they call him Number Two.&rdquo; This
man wore a fur coat over pale blue silk pyjamas.
When he turned, saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing,&rdquo; she was
ready with her stammered, &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard it, then?&rdquo; said Molloy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a fearful crash! It&mdash;it frightened me most
dreadfully,&rdquo;&mdash;and here Jane spoke the literal truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; It was Molloy who answered
again, but the other man&rsquo;s eyes travelled round the
room, and a feeling of terror came over Jane.</p>
<p>If she had forgotten anything, if there were one
shred of incriminating evidence, those eyes would miss
nothing! She felt as if they must pierce the bedclothes
and see her bag and the hidden key, but he
merely nodded to Molloy, and they left the room,
switching out the light and locking the door.</p>
<p>Jane drew a long breath of relief, turned upon her
side, and in five minutes was asleep again.</p>
<p>The day came in with a thick mist. Jane opened her
eyes upon it sleepily.</p>
<p>She began to think what a strange dream she had
had, and then, as sleep ebbed from her, she remembered
that it was not a dream at all. She was Renata
Molloy under lock and key, and in front of her
stretched a day that might be even more crowded with
adventure than yesterday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>She jumped out of bed, and as she dressed her eyes
brightened and her courage rose. With Renata&rsquo;s
scissors she unpicked the initials which marked her
underclothes. This was a game at which one must not
make a single slip. Her bag worried her a little, but
it was just such a plain leather bag as any one might
possess. She ransacked it carefully, and frowned over
an envelope addressed to Miss Jane Smith. What in
the world was she to do with it?</p>
<p>There were no matches, so it could not be burned.
After some thought she soaked it in water, scratched
the name to shreds with a hairpin, and crumpling the
wet paper into a ball, tossed it out of the window.</p>
<p>By the time her door was unlocked, she was very
hungry. This time, it appeared, she was being summoned
to bid the departing Mr. Molloy a fond farewell.</p>
<p>His luggage was already being carried out to the lift,
and two or three men were coming and going. The
man in the fur coat stood with his back to the window,
smoking a cigarette. Obviously Molloy&rsquo;s farewell was
not to be said in private.</p>
<p>Jane looked at him with some curiosity&mdash;a tall man,
strongly built, with a bold air and a florid complexion.</p>
<p>It was he who had opened the door, and he stood still
holding the handle and looking, not at Jane, but over
her shoulder. For this she felt grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well then, I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; said Molloy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be a good girl and do as you&rsquo;re bid, and I&rsquo;ll be having
you out to keep house for me in less than no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From what she had seen of Renata, Jane fancied that
a sob would meet the occasion. She therefore sobbed,
and pressed her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said Molloy hastily.</p>
<p>He bent and deposited an awkward kiss upon the top
of her head. Then he took his hand from the door
and was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The lift gate clanged, and Jane realised that the real
adventure had begun.</p>
<p>The man by the window threw the end of his
cigarette into the fireplace and came towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parental devotion is a beautiful thing, isn&rsquo;t it,
Miss Renata? Suppose we have some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A meal, a proper meal, enough to eat! As she
passed into the dining-room and beheld a ham, coffee,
and boiled eggs, Jane felt as if she could confront
any one or anything. Besides, the first trick was
hers.</p>
<p>In the full light of day, and under those cold, pale
eyes, she had passed as Renata.</p>
<p>She allowed herself to sigh and dab her eyes, and
then&mdash;oh, how good was the rather stale bread, the
London egg, and the indifferent ham.</p>
<p>The man watched her quizzically.</p>
<p>As she finished her second cup of coffee, he remarked
that she had a good appetite, and there was something
in his tone that cast a chill upon the proceedings.</p>
<p>Jane pushed back her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I think we must talk.
Yes, sit down again, please. I won&rsquo;t keep you very
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane did as she was told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Molloy&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know what
that means? He&rsquo;s washed his hands of you. Just
in case&mdash;just in case, you&rsquo;ve been relying on Molloy,
I would like to point out to you that his own position
is none too secure. The firm he works for has not been
entirely satisfied with him for some time. It is, therefore,
quite out of the question that he should influence
any decision that may be come to with regard to yourself.
His going off like this shows that he realises
the position and accepts it. Self-preservation is
Molloy&rsquo;s trump suit, first, last, and all the time. I
shouldn&rsquo;t advise you to count upon trifles like parental
devotion, or anything of that sort. In a word&mdash;he
can&rsquo;t help you, <i>but I can</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man leaned forward as he spoke, and a sudden
smile changed his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be frank,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Tell me what you
really heard, and I&rsquo;ll see you through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane let her eyes meet his. That smile had puzzled
her; it was so spontaneous and charming, but it did
not reach his eyes.</p>
<p>She looked and found them cold and opaque, and as
she looked, she saw the pupils narrow, expand, and
then narrow again.</p>
<p>He got up from his chair, walked to the mantelpiece,
stopped for a light to his cigarette, and came back
again with a thin blue haze of smoke about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I haven&rsquo;t been altogether frank with you,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;That little romance of mine about a firm of
chemists who employ your father&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t really
believe it? No, I thought not. The fact is, that first
night I took you for just a schoolgirl, and one can&rsquo;t
tell schoolgirls everything. But now, now I&rsquo;m talking
to you as a woman. I can&rsquo;t tell you everything,
even so, but I can tell you this. It&rsquo;s a Government
matter, a most important one, and it is vital that I
should know just what you overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;I
was dreaming and I waked up suddenly. There was a
screen in front of me, and some one on the other side
of the screen called out very loud, &lsquo;The door, the
door!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the pale eyes upon her face. Then with an
abrupt movement the man came over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jane stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked at him.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a very long time, he threw
out his hand with an impatient gesture. It struck the
table edge with a sharp rap, the spring that held his
wrist watch gave, and the watch on its gold curb flew
off and fell on the floor behind Jane.</p>
<p>She turned, glad of an excuse to turn, and bent to
pick it up. The back of the watch was open; her
fingers caught and closed it instantly, but not for
nothing had she told Henry that she had gimlet eyes.
The back of the watch contained a photograph, and
Jane had seen the photograph before. Henry&rsquo;s voice
sounded in her ears. &ldquo;It was done from Amory&rsquo;s portrait
of her, in 1915&mdash;the year of her marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number Two, the man in the fur coat, Renata&rsquo;s
&ldquo;worst of them all,&rdquo; had in the back of his watch a
photograph of Lady Heritage!</p>
<p>Jane laid the watch on the table without giving it
a second glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span></h2>
<p>As the watch slid back into its place beneath his
shirt cuff, the man spoke with an entire change
of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Renata, that was all very stiff and
businesslike. You mustn&rsquo;t hold it up against me,
because I hope we&rsquo;re going to be friends. Don&rsquo;t you
want to know your plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked at him with a little frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going to happen to you. Oh, please,
don&rsquo;t look so grave! It&rsquo;s nothing very dreadful.
You have heard of Sir William Carr-Magnus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said Jane. She hoped that she
looked innocent and surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man in the fur coat, &ldquo;I happen to
be his secretary, and that reminds me, I don&rsquo;t believe
you know my name. Your father and his friends use
a ridiculous nickname which sticks to me like a
burr ... but let me introduce myself&mdash;Jeffrey Ember,
and your friend, if you will have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charming smile just touched his face, and then
he said in a quiet, serious way:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William&rsquo;s daughter, Lady Heritage, has
commissioned me to find her an amanuensis&mdash;companion&mdash;no,
that&rsquo;s not quite right either. She doesn&rsquo;t
want a trained stenographer, or a young person with
a business training, but she wants a girl in the house&mdash;some
one who&rsquo;ll do what she&rsquo;s told, write notes,
arrange the flowers.... I dare say you can guess
the sort of thing. She is willing to give you a trial,
and your father has agreed. As a matter of fact,
I&rsquo;m taking you down there to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jane, because she seemed expected to
say something, and for the life of her she could not
think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to submit to certain restrictions
at Luttrell Marches. You see, Sir William is
engaged upon some very important experiments for
the Government, and all the members of his household
have to conform to certain regulations. Their
letters must be censored, and they must not leave the
grounds, which are, however, extremely delightful and
extensive. It isn&rsquo;t much of a hardship, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Jane in her best schoolgirl manner.</p>
<p>And there the interview ended.</p>
<p>They made the journey to Luttrell Marches by car,
but, after the manner of Mrs. Gilpin&rsquo;s post-chaise,
it did not pick them up at the door. An ordinary
taxi conveyed them to Victoria Station, and it was in
the station yard that they and their luggage were
picked up by the Rolls-Royce with the Carr-Magnus
crest upon the door.</p>
<p>The mist was thinner, and as they came clear of
London, the sun came out. The day warmed into
beauty, and the green growth of the countryside
seemed to be expanding before their eyes. So many
long hedges running into a blur, so many miles of road
all slipping past. Jane fell fast asleep, and did not
know how long she slept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>It was in the late afternoon that they came into the
Marsh country&mdash;great flat stretches of it, set with
boggy tussocks and intersected by straight lanes of
water. Purple-brown and green it stretched for miles.
To the right a humped line of upland, but to the left,
and as far as the eye could see in front, nothing but
marsh. Then the road rose a little; the ground was
firmer and carried a black pine or two.</p>
<p>They came to a three-cross way and turned sharply
to the right. The ground rose more and more. They
climbed a steep hill, zigzagging between banked-up
hedges to make the rise, and came out upon a bare
upland. Ahead of them one saw a high stone wall
pierced by iron gates. The car stopped. Mr. Ember
leaned out, and after a pause the gates swung inwards.</p>
<p>For a mile the drive lay through a flat waste of
springing bracken, with here and there a group of
wind-driven trees, then a second gate through a high
fencing topped with wire. An avenue of trees led
up to the house, a huge grey pile set against a sky full
of little racing clouds.</p>
<p>Jane felt stiff and bewildered with the long drive.
She followed Mr. Ember up a flight of granite steps
and came into the great hall of Luttrell Marches
with its panelled walls and dark old portraits of
half-forgotten Luttrells.</p>
<p>Exactly opposite the entrance rose the stairway
which was the pride of the house. Its beautiful
proportions, the grapes and vine leaves of its famous
carvings, were lighted from beneath by the red glow
of a huge open fire, and from above by the last word
in electric lighting.</p>
<p>Ember walked straight across the hall and up the
stair, and Jane followed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>She thought she knew exactly how a puppy must
feel when, blinking from the warmth and straw of his
basket, he comes for the first time into the ordered
solemnity of his new master&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And then she looked up and saw The Portrait.</p>
<p>It hung on the panelling at the top of the stair
where the long corridors ran off to right and left, and
it took Jane&rsquo;s breath away&mdash;the portrait of Lady
Heritage.</p>
<p>Amory had painted more than a beautiful woman
standing on a marble terrace: he had painted a woman
Mercury. The hands held an ivory rod&mdash;diamond
wings rose from the cloudy hair. Under the bright
wings the eyes looked out, looked far&mdash;dark, splendid,
hungry eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth belongs to her, and she despises it,&rdquo;
was Jane&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>She stood staring at the portrait. Nineteen-fifteen,
Henry had said&mdash;the year when other women posed
with folded linen hiding their hair and the red cross
worn like a blazon. She could think of several famous
beauties who had been painted thus. But this woman
wore her diamond wings, though, even as she wore
them, Fate had done its worst to her, for Anthony
Luttrell was a name with other names in a list of
missing, and no man knew his grave.</p>
<p>A sharp clang of metal upon metal startled Jane.
She looked quickly to her right, and saw that a steel
gate completely barred the entrance to the corridor on
that side. It had just closed behind a curious white-draped
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jeffrey,&rdquo; said a voice&mdash;a deep, rather husky
voice&mdash;and the figure came forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Jane saw that it was a woman wearing a long white
linen overall, and a curious linen head-dress, which she
was undoing and pushing back as she walked. She
pulled it off as she came up to them, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
hot in there I can hardly breathe, but too fascinating
to leave. You&rsquo;re early. Is this Miss Molloy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put out her hand to Jane, and Jane, with her
mind full of the portrait, looked open-eyed at its
original.</p>
<p>Afterwards she tried to formulate her sensations,
but, at the time, she received just that emotional
shock which most people experienced when they first
met Raymond Heritage.</p>
<p>Beautiful&mdash;but there are so many beautiful women.
Charming? No, there was rather something that
repelled, antagonised. In her presence Jane felt untidy,
shabby, gauche.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage unbuttoned her overall and slipped it
off. She wore a plain white knitted skirt and jersey.
Her fingers were bare even of the wedding ring which
Jane looked for and missed. Her black hair was a
little ruffled, and above the temples, where Amory
had painted diamond wings, there were streaks of
grey.</p>
<p>Bewilderment came down on Jane like a thick mist,
which clung about her during the brief interchange of
sentences which followed, and went with her to her
room.</p>
<p>It was a queer room with a rounded wall set with
three windows and to right and left irregular of line,
with a jutting corner here and a blunted angle there.
It faced west, for the sun shone level in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Crossing to the window, as most people do when they
come into a strange room, she looked out and caught
her breath with amazement.</p>
<p>The sea&mdash;why, it seemed to lie just beneath the
windows!</p>
<p>They had driven up from the landward side, and this
was her first hint that the sea was so near.</p>
<p>There was a wide gravel terrace, a stone wall set with
formal urns full of blue hyacinths, the sharp fall of the
cliff, and then the sea.</p>
<p>The tide was in, the sun low, and a wide golden path
seemed to stretch almost from Jane&rsquo;s feet to the far
horizon. Overhead the little racing clouds that told of
a wind high up were golden too.</p>
<p>The humped ridge of upland, which Jane had seen as
they drove, ran out to sea on the right hand. It ended
in low, broken cliff, and a line of jagged rocks of which
only the points stood clear.</p>
<p>Jane turned from all the beauty outside to the
ordered comfort within. Hot water in a brass can that
she could see her face in, a towel of such fine linen that
it was a joy to touch it, this pretty white-panelled
room, the chintzes where bright butterflies hovered over
roses and sweet-peas&mdash;she stood and looked at it all,
and she heard Renata&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;At Luttrell Marches
they will decide whether I am to be eliminated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This curious dual sense remained with her during the
days that followed. Life at Luttrell Marches was
simple and regular. She wrote letters, gathered flowers,
unpacked the library books, and kept out of Sir
William&rsquo;s way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Sir William, she decided, was exactly like his photograph,
only a good deal more so; his eyebrows more
tufted, his chin more jutting, and his eyes harder.
For a philanthropist he had a singularly bad temper,
and for so eminent a scientist a very frivolous taste in
literature. One of Jane&rsquo;s duties was to provide him
with novels. She ransacked library lists and trembled
over the results of her labours.</p>
<p>Sir William did not always join the ladies after dinner,
but when he did so he would read a novel at a
sitting and ask for more.</p>
<p>Mr. Ember was never absent, and when Lady
Heritage talked, it was to him that her words were
addressed. Sometimes she would disappear inside the
steel gate for hours.</p>
<p>Jane soon learnt that the whole of the north wing
was given up to Sir William&rsquo;s experiments. On each
floor a steel gate shut it off from the rest of the house.
All the windows were barred from top to bottom.</p>
<p>She also discovered that the high paling where the
avenue began had, on its inner side, an apron of barbed
wire, and it was the upper strand of this apron which
she had seen as they approached from outside.</p>
<p>Sir William&rsquo;s experiments employed a considerable
number of men. These, she learned, were lodged in the
stables, and neither they nor any of the domestic staff
were permitted to pass beyond the inner paling.</p>
<p>On the coast side there was a high wire entanglement&mdash;electrified.</p>
<p>There were moments when Jane was cold with fear,
and moments when she told herself that Renata was a
little fool who had had nightmare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span></h2>
<p>When Jane stood at her window and looked
across the sea, she saw what might have been
a picture of life at Luttrell Marches during those first
few days. Such a smooth stretch of water, pleasant to
the eye, where blue and green, amethyst, grey and
silver came and went, and under the play of colour and
the shifting light and shade of day and evening, the
unchanging black of rocks which showed for an instant
and then left one guessing whether anything had really
broken the beauty and the peace.</p>
<p>Over the surface all was pleasant enough, but incidents,
some of them almost negligible in themselves,
kept recurring to remind Jane that there were rocks
beneath the sea.</p>
<p>The first incident came up suddenly whilst she
was writing Lady Heritage&rsquo;s letters on the second
day.</p>
<p>She had beside her a little pile of correspondence,
mostly about trifles. Upon each letter there was
scrawled, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Tell them I&rsquo;ll think it
over,&rdquo; or some such direction.</p>
<p>Presently Jane arrived at a letter in French, upon
which Lady Heritage had written, &ldquo;Make an English
translation and enclose to Mrs. Blunt.&rdquo; Mrs. Blunt&rsquo;s
own letter lay immediately underneath. It contained
inquiries about some conditions of factory labour
amongst women in France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The French letter was an excellent exposition of the
said conditions.</p>
<p>Jane sat looking at it, and wondering whether Renata
could have translated a single line of it, and how much
ignorance it would behove her to display.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s thought she turned round and said
timidly, &ldquo;May I have a dictionary, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage looked up from the papers before her.
She frowned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dictionary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the French letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know French, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane met the half-sarcastic look with protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I <i>do</i>. But, if I might have a
dictionary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage pointed to the bookcase and went
back to her papers.</p>
<p>An imp of mischief entered into Jane.</p>
<p>She took the dictionary and spent the next half-hour
in producing a translation with just the right amount
of faults in it. She put it down in front of her employer
with a feeling of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, will this do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage looked, frowned, and tore the paper
across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you knew French?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane fidgeted with her pen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know I&rsquo;m not <i>really</i> good at it, but I
looked out all the words I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been a good many,&rdquo; was Lady
Heritage&rsquo;s comment, and the imp made Jane raise
innocent eyes and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there <i>were</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>She went back to her table, and Lady Heritage spoke
over her shoulder to Mr. Ember, who appeared to be
searching for a book at the far end of the room. She
spoke in French&mdash;the low, rapid French of the woman
to whom one language is the same as another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they teach at English schools, can you
tell me, Jeffrey? This girl says she knows French, and
if she can follow one word I am saying now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
broke off and shrugged. &ldquo;Yet I dare say she went to
an expensive school. Now, I had a Bavarian maid,
educated in the ordinary village school, and she spoke
English with ease, and French better than any English
schoolgirl I&rsquo;ve come across. Wait whilst I try her in
something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned back to Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just send the original to Mrs. Blunt&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t
time to bother with it&mdash;and make a note for me. I want
it inserted after para three on the second page of that
typewritten article that came back this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane supposed she might be allowed to know what
a &ldquo;para&rdquo; was. She turned over the leaves of the
typescript and waited for the dictation. The last
sentence read, &ldquo;Woman through all the ages is at the
disposal and under the autocratic rule of man, but it is
not of her own volition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered what was to come next, and waited,
keenly on the alert.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage began to speak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it in as neatly as possible, please; it&rsquo;s only
one sentence: &lsquo;It is Man who has forced &ldquo;das ewig
Weibliche&rdquo; upon us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane wrote, &ldquo;It is man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then stopped.
She repeated the words aloud and looked expectant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Das ewig Weibliche&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;there was a slight grimness
in Lady Heritage&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard the quotation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know any German, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, what did they teach you at that
school of yours? By the way, where was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Ilfracombe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English education is a disgrace,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage,
and went back to her papers.</p>
<p>It was next day that she turned suddenly to Jane:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, you were at school at Ilfracombe&mdash;can
you give me the name of a china shop there? I
want some of that blue Devonshire pottery for a girls&rsquo;
club I&rsquo;m interested in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane had a moment of panic. Renata&rsquo;s shoes had
fitted her too easily. She had felt secure, and then to
have her security shattered by a trifle like this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A china shop?&rdquo; she said meditatively; then, after
a pause, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully stupid of me&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
forgotten the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shop that you must have passed hundreds of
times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very stupid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage smiled with a sudden brilliance.
&ldquo;Well, it is rather,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was on the fourth day that Jane really caught her
first glimpse of the black rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>She was writing in the library, dealing with an
apparently endless stream of begging letters, requests
for interviews, invitations to speak at meetings or to
join committees.</p>
<p>In four days Jane had discovered that Lady Heritage
was up to her eyes in a dozen movements relating to
feminist activities, women&rsquo;s labour, and social reform.</p>
<p>Newspapers, pamphlets, and reports littered a table
which ran the whole length of the room. Jane was
required to open all these as they came, and separate
those which dealt with social reform and the innumerable
scientific treatises and reviews. These latter
arrived in every European language.</p>
<p>Jane sat writing. The day was clear and lovely,
the air sun-warmed and yet fresh as if it had passed
over snow. April has days like this, and they fill
every healthy person with a longing to be out, to stop
working, and take holiday.</p>
<p>The windows of the library looked out upon the
gravel terrace above the sea. The sun was on the blue
water.</p>
<p>Jane put down her pen and looked at the hyacinths
in the grey stone urns. They were blue too. A yellow
butterfly played round them. She sat up and went
to the window.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage and Mr. Ember were walking up and
down the terrace, Lady Heritage bareheaded, all in
white with not even a scarf, and Jeffrey Ember with
a muffler round his neck, and the inevitable fur coat.
They were coming towards her, and Jane stood back
so that the curtains made a screen. She watched
Raymond Heritage as she had watched the sea and
the flowers, for sheer joy in her beauty.</p>
<p>Raymond&rsquo;s face was towards her, and she was
speaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Not a word reached Jane&rsquo;s ears, but as she looked
at those beautiful lips, their movements spelt words
to her&mdash;words and sentences. She would have drawn
back or looked away, but the first sentence that she
read riveted her attention too closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied about her Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember <i>must</i> have spoken, but his head was turned
away. Then Raymond spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor am I&mdash;not entirely. She seems intelligent
and unintelligent by turns, unbelievably stupid in one
direction and quick in another.&rdquo; They passed level
with the window, and so on to the end of the terrace.
Jane went round the table to the other side of the
window and waited for them to come back.</p>
<p>Ember&rsquo;s face was towards her when they turned,
too far away for her to see anything. But, as they came
nearer, she saw that he was speaking. Not easy to
read from, however, with those straight, thin lips that
moved so little. There was only one word she was
sure of&mdash;&ldquo;overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too tantalising. If she had to wait until
they reached the far end of the terrace and turned
again, what might she not miss?</p>
<p>As the thought passed through her mind Lady
Heritage stopped, walked slowly to the grey stone wall,
and sat down on it, motioning to Ember to do the
same.</p>
<p>Jane could see both faces now, and Raymond was
saying, &ldquo;If she overheard anything, would she have
the intelligence to be dangerous?&mdash;that is what I ask
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember&rsquo;s lips just moved, but the movements made
no sense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage;
&ldquo;despise not thine enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She changed her position, leaned forward, displaying
a statuesque profile, and appeared to be speaking fast
and earnestly. Then Jane saw her lips again, and
they were saying, &ldquo;Anything but Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane gripped the curtain which she held until the
gold galon which bordered it marked her hand with
its acorn pattern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo;!&rdquo; everything swam round her while
she heard Renata&rsquo;s gasping voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said &lsquo;With Formula &ldquo;A&rdquo; you have the key.
When Formula &ldquo;B&rdquo; is also complete, you will have
the lock for that key to fit; then the treasures of the
world are yours.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mist cleared from her eyes; she looked again.</p>
<p>Raymond Heritage had risen to her feet. Ember
and she looked out to sea for a moment, then crossed
the gravel towards the house. They were talking of
the sunshine and the spring air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bulbs have done well,&rdquo; Lady Heritage said.</p>
<p>They passed out of sight.</p>
<p>Two days later Jane, coming down the corridor to
the library, was aware of voices in conversation. She
opened the door and saw Jeffrey Ember with his back
to her. He had pulled a deep leather chair close to
the fire, and was bending forward to warm his hands.
Lady Heritage stood a yard or two away. She had a
large bunch of violets in one hand; with the other she
leaned against the black marble mantel.</p>
<p>She and Ember were talking in German. Both
glanced round, and Raymond asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;The letters for the post,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>They went on talking whilst she sorted and stamped
the letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of us is the better judge of character, it
comes to that.&rdquo; Speaking German, Lady Heritage&rsquo;s
deep voice sounded deeper than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we take different sides then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I thought your verdict was inclined
to be &lsquo;Guilty, but recommended to mercy,&rsquo; whereas
mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated&mdash;stopped rather&mdash;for there
was no hesitation in her manner.</p>
<p>Ember made a gesture with the hand that held his
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt the guilt. But if I did not doubt, I should
have no mercy at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane went out with the letters, and when she was in
the corridor again she put out her hand and leaned
against the wall. It would be horrible enough, she
thought, to be tried in an open court upon some capital
count, but how far less horrible than a secret judgment
where whispered words made unknown charges, where
the trial went on beneath the surface of one&rsquo;s pleasant
daily life, and every word, every look, a turn of the
head, an unguarded sigh, a word too little, or a glance
too much might tip the scale and send the balance
swinging down to&mdash;what?</p>
<p>Next day Lady Heritage was deep in her correspondence,
when she suddenly flashed into anger. Pushing
back her chair, she got up and began to pace the room.
There was a letter in her hand, and as she walked she
tore it across and across, flung the fragments into the fire,
and pushed a blazing log down upon them with her foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Jane and Ember watched her&mdash;the former with
some surprise and a good deal of admiration, the latter
with that odd something which her presence always
called out. She swung round, met his eyes, and burst
into speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Alington&mdash;to think that I ever called that man
my friend! I wonder if there&rsquo;s a single man on this
earth who would translate professions of devotion to
one woman, into bare decent justice to all women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has Lord Alington done?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ember,
with a slight drawl.</p>
<p>Jane, with a thrill, identified the President of the
Board of Trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I might not have expected. It is
only women that are different, Jeffrey. Men are all
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still I don&rsquo;t know what he has done,&rdquo; said
Jeffrey Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long story! I&rsquo;ve been pressing for women
inspectors in various directions. It seems inconceivable
that any one should cavil at a woman inspector
wherever women are employed. You have no idea of
what some of the conditions are. Stewardesses, for
instance; I&rsquo;ve a letter there from a woman who has
been working on one of the largest liners&mdash;not a tramp
steamer, mind you, but one of the biggest liners
afloat. All the passengers&rsquo; trays, all the cabin meals
had to be carried up a perpendicular iron stair like a
fire-escape&mdash;not a permanent stair, you understand,
but a ladder that is let up and down. Those wretched
women had to go up and down it all day with heavy
trays. They said they couldn&rsquo;t do it, and were told
they had to. And that&rsquo;s a little thing compared to
some of the other conditions. I want an inspector for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Alington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage came to a halt by the long, piled-up
table. She struck it with her open hand. &ldquo;Lord
Alington is just a man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He stands for
what men have always stood for, the sacred right of the
vested interest. What man ever wants to alter anything?
And why should he when the existing order
gives him all he wants? It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you
turn, what you do, how hard you try, the vested interest
blocks the way; you are up against the Established
Order of what has always been. My God, how I&rsquo;d like
to smash it all, the whole thing, the whole smug sham
which we call civilisation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane stared at her open-eyed. She had never
dreamed that the statue could wake into such vivid
life as this. The colour burned in Raymond&rsquo;s cheeks,
the sombre eyes were sombre still, but they held sparks
as if from inward fire.</p>
<p>Ember touched the hand that was clenched at the
table&rsquo;s edge. A sort of tremor passed over her from
head to foot. The colour died, the fire was gone.
With a complete change of manner she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alington was hardly worth all that, was he?&rdquo;
Then without a change of key, but in German:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jeffrey, the child&rsquo;s eyes were nearly
falling out of her head. It was stupid of me; I forgot.
These things carry me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened on her last words, and Sir William
came in. He was frowning, and appeared to be in a
great hurry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous business, ridiculous waste of time.
These damned departments appear to think I&rsquo;ve
nothing to do with my time except to answer their
infernal inquiries, and entertain any interfering jackanapes
that they choose to let loose on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it Father?&rdquo; said Lady Heritage&mdash;&ldquo;Government
inspection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Sir William slowly. &ldquo;Henry
March wants to come down for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane bent forward over her papers. No one was
looking at her, no one was thinking of her, but she had
felt her cheeks grow hot, and was glad of an excuse to
hide them.</p>
<p>She did not know whether she was very much afraid
or very glad. A feeling unfamiliar but overwhelming
seemed to shake her to the depths. She was quite
unconscious of what was passing behind her.</p>
<p>At Henry&rsquo;s name, Raymond Heritage uttered a
sharp, &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; She came quickly forward as she
spoke and caught the letter from Sir William&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t come&mdash;I can&rsquo;t have him here&mdash;put him
off, Father; you can make some excuse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Sir William again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
nuisance, of course&mdash;it&rsquo;s an infernal nuisance&mdash;but
he&rsquo;ll have to come, confound him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as she made a half-articulate protest, he
went on with increasing loss of temper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! I can&rsquo;t very well tell the man I
won&rsquo;t have him in what is practically his own
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ember, not her father, who saw how frightfully
pale Raymond became. In a very low voice she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Sir William was fidgeting. He looked at Jane&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;s coming down on business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he broke off and stared at Jane again.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can take half an
hour off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span></h2>
<p>Henry arrived on the following day and was
shown straight into Sir William&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Sir William rang the bell and sent
for Lady Heritage. He hardly gave her time to shake
hands before he burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you must be told. I take all responsibility
for your being told. After all, if I am conducting
these experiments, something is due to me,
though the Government appear to think otherwise.
But I take all responsibility; I insist on your being
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat at his littered table, and all the time that he
was speaking his hands were lifting and shuffling the
papers on it. At his elbow stood a tray with tantalus
and glasses and a syphon. Only one glass had been
used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>
<p>Her eyes went from her father to Henry.</p>
<p>Sir William&rsquo;s hand was shaking. Henry wore a
look of grave concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Sir William&rsquo;s voice was just
a deep growl. &ldquo;He comes here, and he tells me that
Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; has been stolen. I&rsquo;ve told him to his
face, and I tell him again, that it&rsquo;s a damned
impossibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The shaking hand fell heavily upon the table and
made the glasses ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Raymond&mdash;&ldquo;stolen? Henry,
you can&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I do,&rdquo; said Henry, at his quietest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. We have the
most indisputable evidence that Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; has
been offered to&mdash;well, to a foreign power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flush upon Sir William&rsquo;s face deepened alarmingly.
Under the bristling grey brows his eyes were
hard with anger. He began to speak, broke off, swept
his papers to one side, and, taking up the tantalus
and the used glass, poured out a third of a glass of
whisky. He let a small quantity of soda into it with
a vicious jerk, and then sat with the glass between his
hands, alternately sipping from it and interjecting
sounds of angry protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The information is, I&rsquo;m afraid, correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s tone, though studiously moderate, was
extremely firm. &ldquo;There is undoubtedly a leak, and,
in view of Formula &lsquo;B,&rsquo; it is vital that the leak should
be found and stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He addressed himself to Lady Heritage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William tells me that all employ&eacute;s correspond
with the list in my possession, that none of them leave
the enclosure, and that all letters are censored. By
the way, who censors them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ember,&rdquo; growled Sir William.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage elaborated the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ember&mdash;Father&rsquo;s secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and Henry were both standing, with the corner
of the writing-table between them. She saw inquiry
in Henry&rsquo;s face. He said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who does leave the premises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, once in a blue moon, I when I have any
shopping to do, and, of course, Mr. Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you go you drive, of course? What I
mean is&mdash;a chauffeur goes too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir William made a sound between a snort and a
laugh; Lady Heritage smiled. Both had the air of
being pleased to catch Henry out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chauffeur is Lewis, who was your uncle&rsquo;s
coachman here for twenty-five years. Are you going
to suggest that he has been selling Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; to a
foreign power? I&rsquo;m afraid you must think again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir William exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ember&rsquo;s my secretary. He&rsquo;s been my right hand
for ten years, and if you&rsquo;re going to make insinuations
about him, you can leave my house and make them
elsewhere. Why, damn it all, March!&mdash;why not accuse
Raymond, or me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t accuse any one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, whilst the two men looked at one
another. It was Sir William who looked away at last.
He drained his glass and got up, pushing his chair so
hard that it overturned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see all the men to check &rsquo;em by that
infernal list of yours, do you? The sooner the better
then; let&rsquo;s get it over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Later, as the men answered to their names in the long,
bare room which had once been the Blue Parlour, Henry
was struck with the strangeness of the scene. Here
his aunt had loved to sit doing an interminable embroidery
of fruits and flowers upon canvas. Here he
and Anthony had lain prone before the fire, each
with his head in a book and his heels waving aloft.
Memories of Fenimore Cooper and Henty filled the
place when for a moment he closed his eyes. Then, as
they opened, there was the room all bare, the windows
barred and uncurtained, the long stretcher tables with
their paraphernalia of glass retorts, queer, twisted
apparatus, powerful electric appliances, and this row of
men answering to their names whilst he checked each
from his list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Mallaby.&rdquo; He called the name and glanced
from the man who answered it to the paper in his hand.
A small photograph was followed by a description: &ldquo;5
feet 7 inches, grey eyes, mole on chin, fair complexion,
sandy hair.&rdquo; All correct. He passed to the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob Moss&mdash;5 feet 5 inches, dark complexion,
black hair and eyes, no marks....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Patterson&mdash;5 feet 10 inches, sallow complexion,
brown hair and beard, grey on temples, grey
eyes, scar....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who answered to the name of George
Patterson stepped forward. He had the air of being
taller than his scheduled height. His beard and hair
were unkempt, and the scar set down against him
was a red seam that ran from the left temple to the
chin, where it lost itself in grizzled hair. He stooped,
and walked with a dragging step.</p>
<p>Henry, who for the moment was speaking to Sir
William, looked at him casually enough. He opened
his list, and in turning the page, the papers slipped
from his hand and fell. George Patterson picked them
up. Henry went on to the next name.</p>
<p>Jane had keyed herself up to meeting him at teatime,
but neither Henry nor Sir William appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain March is an extremely conscientious
person,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage. It was not a trait which
appeared to commend itself to her. &ldquo;I should think
he must have interviewed the very black-beetles by
now. Have you been passed, Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Ember, &ldquo;but it hasn&rsquo;t
taken away my appetite for tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact it had not. It was Raymond who ate
nothing.</p>
<p>Jane and Henry did not meet until dinner-time. As
she dressed, Jane kept looking at herself in the glass.
She was pale, and she must not look pale. She took a
towel and rubbed her cheeks&mdash;that was better. Then
a little later, when she looked again, her eyes were far
too bright, her face unnaturally flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if any one was going to look at you at all&mdash;idiot!&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>After this she kept her back to the mirror.</p>
<p>In all the books that she had ever read the secretary
or companion invariably wore a dinner dress of black
silk made, preferably, out of one which had belonged to
a grandmother or some even more remote relative.
In this garb she outshone all the other women and
annexed the affections of at least two of the most
eligible men.</p>
<p>Renata did not possess a black silk gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, for I should look perfectly awful
in it,&rdquo; was Jane&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>With almost equal distaste she viewed the white
muslin sacred to prize-givings and school concerts.
Attired in this garment Renata had played the
&ldquo;Sonata Path&eacute;tique&rdquo; amidst the applause of boarders
and parents. With this pale blue sash about her
waist she had recited &ldquo;How they brought the Good
News from Ghent to Aix.&rdquo; Jane tied it in a vicious
knot. Her only comfort as she went downstairs was
that it was impossible to look more like a schoolgirl
and less like a conspirator.</p>
<p>Sir William and Henry were in the hall&mdash;Mr. Ember
too, close to the fire as usual.</p>
<p>Sir William jerked his head in Jane&rsquo;s direction and
grunted, &ldquo;Miss Molloy, my daughter&rsquo;s secretary.&rdquo;
Henry bowed. Jane inclined her head.</p>
<p>Next moment they all turned to watch Raymond
Heritage come down the stair.</p>
<p>She wore black velvet. Her neck and arms were
bare. A long rope of pearls fell to her knee.</p>
<p>Jane wondered whether the world held another
woman so beautiful, then looked quickly at Henry,
and the same thought was visible upon Henry&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>Dinner was not a cheerful meal. Lady Heritage
hardly opened her lips. Sir William sat hunched forward
over the table; when addressed, the remark
had to be repeated before he answered; he drank a
good deal.</p>
<p>Jane considered that a modest silence became her,
and the conversation was sustained with some effect
of strain by Captain March and Mr. Ember. They
talked fitfully of politics, musical comedy, the weather,
and the American Exchange.</p>
<p>It was a relief, to Jane at least, when she and Lady
Heritage found their way to the drawing-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Henry wondered at their using this large, formal
room for so small a party. His aunt, he remembered,
had kept it shut up for the most part. The sense of
space was, however, grateful to Jane. The small
circle of candlelight in the dining-room had seemed
to shut them in, forcing an intimacy for which no one
of them was prepared.</p>
<p>The Yellow Drawing-Room was a very stately apartment.
The walls were hung with a Chinese damask
which a hundred years had not robbed of its imperial
colour. Beneath their pagoda-patterned blue linen
covers Jane knew that the chairs and sofas wore a
stiff yellow satin like a secret pride. Electric candles
in elaborate sconces threw a cold, steady light upon
the scene.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage sat by the fire, the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> in her hand. Her eyes were on the page and
never left it, but she was not reading. In fifteen
minutes her glance had not shifted, and the page remained
unturned.</p>
<p>Then the door opened, and the two younger men
came in. Lady Heritage looked up for a moment,
and then went back to her <i>Revue</i>. She made no
attempt to entertain Captain March, who, for his part,
showed some desire to be entertained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are using the big rooms, I see. Aunt Mary
always said they were too cold. You remember she
always sat in the Blue Parlour, or the little oak room
at the head of the stair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond&rsquo;s lip lifted slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the Blue Parlour would not be very
comfortable now,&rdquo; she said without looking up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Henry possessed a persevering nature. He produced,
in rapid succession, a remark about the weather,
an inquiry as to the productiveness of the kitchen
garden, and a comment upon the pleasant warmth of
the log fire. The first and last of these efforts elicited
no reply at all. To the question about the garden
produce Lady Heritage answered that she had no
idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Ember&rsquo;s habitual expression of cynicism became
a trifle more marked.</p>
<p>Jane had the feeling that the pressure in the atmosphere
was steadily on the increase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing something, Raymond,&rdquo; said Henry.
His pleasant ease of manner appeared quite impervious
to snubs.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage closed the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
and, for the first time, looked full at Captain March.
If he was startled by the furious resentment of that
gaze he did not show it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you expect me to sing, Henry?&rdquo;
she said&mdash;&ldquo;the latest out of the <i>Jazz Girls</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind; whatever you like, but do sing,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond got up with an abrupt movement. Walking
to one of the long windows which opened upon the
terrace, she drew the heavy yellow brocade curtain
back with a jerk. Beyond the glass the terrace lay in
deepest shadow, but moonlight touched the sea. She
bent, drew the bolt, and opened half the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room is stifling,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Jeffrey, it&rsquo;s
your fault they pile the fire up so. I wish you&rsquo;d sometimes
look at a calendar and realise that this is April,
not January.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning, she crossed to the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I sing, it will be to please myself, and I shall
probably not please any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Ember came forward and opened the piano. He
bent as he did so, and said a few words very low. She
answered him.</p>
<p>Henry, left by the fireside with Jane, leaned forward
conversationally, the last <i>Punch</i> in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a good cartoon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you seen
it, Miss Molloy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as she bent to look at the page, he added
in that low, effaced tone which does not carry a
yard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which room have they given you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the line,&rdquo; said Jane in her clear voice, &ldquo;and
that very black shadow.&rdquo; Then, in an almost soundless
breath&mdash;&ldquo;The end room, south wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to bed,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Wonderful
how they keep it up, week after week. I mean to
say, it must put you off your stroke like anything,
knowing you&rsquo;ve got to come right up to time like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your department doesn&rsquo;t work by the calendar,
then? You don&rsquo;t have to bother about results?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember strolled back to his favourite place by the
fire as he spoke, and Lady Heritage broke into a resounding
chord. She played what Henry afterwards
described as &ldquo;an infernal pandemonium of a thing.&rdquo;
It appeared to be in several keys at once, and marched
from one riot of discord to another until it ended with
a strident crash which set up a humming jangle of
vibrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like that, Henry?&rdquo; said Lady Heritage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Henry, monosyllabic in his turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever likes to hear the truth,&rdquo; said Raymond.
&ldquo;You all want something pleasant, something smooth,
something like this&rdquo;&mdash;her fingers slipped into the
&ldquo;Blue Danube&rdquo; waltz. She played it exquisitely,
with a melting delicacy of touch and a beautiful sense
of rhythm. After a dozen bars or so she stopped
suddenly, leaned her elbow on the keyboard, and
through the little clang of the impact said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s topping,&rdquo; said Henry. He looked across at
her admiringly&mdash;the long sweep of the ebony piano,
the white keyboard with the black notes standing
clear, Raymond in her velvet and pearls, and behind
her the imperial yellow of China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soothing syrup,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not up to
date, Henry, I&rsquo;m afraid. The moderns show us things
as they are, and we don&rsquo;t like it, but the soothing
syrups lose their power to soothe once you find out
that they are just ... dope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d sing,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>She looked across him at Ember, and an expression
difficult to define hardened her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t modern, but will you like it?&rdquo; she
said, and preluded. Then she began to sing in a
deep mezzo:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Worldly Hope Men set their Hearts upon</p>
<p class="t0">Turns Ashes&mdash;or it prospers; and anon,</p>
<p class="t">Like Snow upon the Desert&rsquo;s dusty Face</p>
<p class="t0">Lighting its little Hour or two&mdash;is gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here in this battered Caravanserai,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day,</p>
<p class="t">How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp</p>
<p class="t0">Abode his destined Hour, and went his Way.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The notes came heavy and tragic. In her voice
there seemed to be gathered all the tragedy, all the
emotion of human life. The sound fell almost to a
whisper:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Worldly Hope Men set their Hearts upon</p>
<p class="t0">Turns Ashes&mdash;or it prospers; and anon,</p>
<p class="t">Like Snow upon the Desert&rsquo;s dusty Face</p>
<p class="t0">Lighting its little Hour or two&mdash;is gone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Suddenly the voice rose ringing like a trumpet, a
great chord crashed out:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Waste not your Hour!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The deep octaves followed. Then she passed into
modulating phrases and began to sing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her voice is nearly as beautiful as she is,&rdquo; thought
Jane, &ldquo;but somehow&mdash;she shakes one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ah Love, could you and I with Fate conspire</p>
<p class="t0">To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,</p>
<p class="t">Would we not shatter it to bits, and then</p>
<p class="t0">Re-mould it nearer to the Heart&rsquo;s Desire?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>With the last word she rose, turned from the piano
and the room, and went out to the terrace.</p>
<p>Henry got up, strolled casually across the room, and
followed her. She was standing by the low parapet
looking over the sea. The night was still, the scent of
hyacinths was heavy on the air, but every now and then
a breath&mdash;something not to be called a wind&mdash;came up
from across the water and brought with it cold, and a
tang of salt.</p>
<p>The moon was still behind the house, but near to clearing
it, and though they stood in the dusk, Henry could
see Lady Heritage&rsquo;s features as though through a veil.</p>
<p>Her icy mood was broken; the tears were rolling down
her cheeks. She turned on him with a flame of anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you come? Why did you come? Do
you know what Father said to me yesterday? I said
I wouldn&rsquo;t have you here, and he said&mdash;he said, &lsquo;Good
heaven! how can I keep the man away from what is
practically his own house?&rsquo; Is it yours now?&mdash;have
you come to see your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry looked at her gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not mine yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I came for a
very different reason, as I think you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expected me to welcome you ... as if
it wasn&rsquo;t enough to be here, to live here&mdash;without&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She broke off, gripping the rough stone of the parapet
with both hands. &ldquo;You ask me why I don&rsquo;t use the
Oak Room&mdash;do you forget how you and I and Tony
used to roast chestnuts there, and tell ghost stories&mdash;till
we were afraid to go to bed? If there were no worse
ghosts than those.... Do you know, every time you
come into the room I expect to see Anthony behind
you, and when you speak I catch myself listening for
his voice?... Do you still wonder why I don&rsquo;t use
the Oak Room? What are men made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Did I hurt you,
Raymond? I&rsquo;m sorry if I did, but it wasn&rsquo;t meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank down upon the parapet. All the vehemence
went out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said in a whispering voice&mdash;&ldquo;you
see, I can&rsquo;t forget. God knows how hard I&rsquo;ve tried.
Every one else has forgotten, but I can&rsquo;t forget. If I
could, I should sleep&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t. Henry, have you
ever tried very hard to forget anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me what it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, and if you really understand,
you know that the more one tries the more
vivid it all becomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tony?&rdquo; asked Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Tony,&rdquo; said Raymond, in an odd voice&mdash;&ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want you to
think that. I could have borne that; I could have
borne anything if I could have seen him once again, or
if he had known that I cared, but he went away in
anger and he never knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Henry&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage looked away across the sea. The
moonlight showed where the jagged line of rocks cut
sharp through the sleeping water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a verse in the Bible&mdash;do you ever read the
Bible, Henry? I don&rsquo;t, but I remember this verse; one
was taught it as a child. &lsquo;Let not the sun go down
upon your wrath.&rsquo; I let the moon rise and go down
on mine.&rdquo; She spoke very, very quietly. &ldquo;Anthony
stood there, just by that urn. He said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have
all the rest of your life to be sorry in....&rsquo; That was
the last thing he said to me. He never forgave, and he
never wrote. I didn&rsquo;t think any man would let me go
so easily, so I married John Heritage to show that I
didn&rsquo;t care. And, whilst we were on our honeymoon,
I saw Anthony&rsquo;s name in the list of missing. Now,
do you wonder that I hate you for coming here, and
for being alive, and taking Tony&rsquo;s place? And do you
wonder that there are times when I hate everything so
much that I&rsquo;d like well enough to see this whole sorry
scheme shattered to bits&mdash;if it could be done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so keen on this shattering business,
Raymond,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s
been about enough of it? There are a lot of rotten
things, and a lot of good things, and they&rsquo;re all mixed
up. If you start shattering, the odds are you bring
down everything together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Raymond, just one word, cold and still.</p>
<p>There was a little pause. Then she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Henry also among the preachers?&rdquo; she said
mockingly. &ldquo;You should take Orders; a surplice
would be becoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was annoyed to feel that he was flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go on preaching?&rdquo; he said, and as he
spoke, Mr. Ember came through the open glass door
with a cloak over his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a relief expedition,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You
must be frozen. Never trust a moonlight night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the wrap about Raymond&rsquo;s shoulders, but
she did not fasten it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She and Ember passed into the lighted room.
Henry stood still for a minute, listened acutely; then
he followed them.</p>
<p>There was a hedge of stiffly growing veronica bushes
at the foot of the terrace wall. After Henry had gone
in, the man called George Patterson came out from
behind the bushes at the far end of the terrace. He
walked slowly with a dragging step, keeping in the
shadow of the house, and he made his way to the far
end of the north wing.</p>
<p>Inside the Yellow Drawing-Room Henry was bidding
his hostess good-night, and announcing his intention
of taking a moonlight stroll.</p>
<p>Presently he emerged upon the terrace, descended
the steps on the right, and made his way in the direction
taken by George Patterson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span></h2>
<p>When Jane reached her own room, she stood
a long time in front of the glass frowning
at herself. It might be safe to look so exactly like
a schoolgirl, but it was very, very humiliating. Henry
had never glanced at her once. That, of course, was
all in the line of safety too. Also, why should Henry
look at her? Why should she wish him to do so?
She was not in love with him; she had, in fact, refused
him&mdash;could it be that there was a little balm in this
thought? What did it matter to her how long he
looked at Raymond Heritage?</p>
<p>She took off the white muslin dress and put it
away.</p>
<p>The worst part of being Renata was, not the risk,
but having to wear Renata&rsquo;s clothes. All the things
were good, horribly good, and they were all quite
extraordinarily dull. &ldquo;If your shoes want mending,
and your things are threadbare, every one knows it&rsquo;s
because you&rsquo;re poor, and not because you like being
down at heel and out at elbows. But Renata&rsquo;s things
must have cost quite a lot, and, of course, every one
thinks they are my choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By some deflected line of reasoning &ldquo;every one&rdquo;
meant Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Jane folded up the pale blue sash and shut it sharply
into a drawer. Then she put on Renata&rsquo;s dressing-gown.
It was made of crimson flannel, very thick and
soft, with scalloped edges to the collar and cuffs&mdash;&ldquo;exactly
like one&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s petticoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rumpled the bedclothes and disarranged the
pillows. Then she put out the light, sat down on the
window-seat, and waited.</p>
<p>The blind was up; she had slipped behind the chintz
curtains. The terrace lay beneath her, only half in
shadow now. There was no sound in the house, no
sound from the sea. The line of shadow moved backwards
inch by inch.</p>
<p>When Jane sat down to wait, she told herself that
she would not listen and strain; she would just sit
there quite peacefully, and if anything was going to
happen&mdash;well, let it happen. But as she sat there, she
became afraid against her will, aware once more of
that sense of pressure which had come upon her in
the drawing-room. It was as if something was
steadily approaching not her alone, but all of them&mdash;as
if their thoughts and actions were being, at one and
the same time, dictated by an outside force and
scrutinised&mdash;watched&mdash;spied upon.</p>
<p>With all her might she resisted this sensation and
the fear that it suggested. But, as the night passed to
midnight and beyond, a strange feeling of being one
watcher in a slumbering household detached itself
from the general confusion, and she began to long with
great intensity for something&mdash;anything&mdash;to happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Once something moved in the foot-wide strip of
shadow against the house. Jane caught her breath
and then saw that it was only a cat, a half-grown
kitten rather, beloved of the cook. It came out
into the moonlight and walked solemnly the entire
length of the terrace with delicately taken steps and
a high waving tail. It was as soundless and black as
the shadow out of which it had come, and presently
it was gone again, and second by second, minute by
minute, slow, interminable, the night dropped away.
In the hall a clock struck the quarters. The silence,
shattered for a moment, closed again.</p>
<p>When the rapping came, it brought the oddest sense
of interruption. Jane sprang to her feet, stood for a
moment catching at her self-control, and then went
noiselessly to the door. She listened before opening
it, and could hear nothing; and, as she listened, the
knocking came again, but from behind her.</p>
<p>Bewildered, she edged the door open and looked
out. A shaded light burned far away to the left.
The long, dim corridor was empty. She shut the door.</p>
<p>Some one was knocking&mdash;somewhere&mdash;but where?</p>
<p>She turned and stood facing the windows. Up in
the far corner a large cupboard filled the angle and
blunted it. Jane had hung her serge dress there hours
and hours ago. The knocking seemed to come from
the cupboard, just where the room was at its darkest
because next the lighted window.</p>
<p>Jane crossed the floor very slowly, put both hands
on the cupboard doors, and flung them wide. For a
moment everything was quite black, then, with a most
unpleasant suddenness, a narrow white ray cut the
dark, and Henry&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s hand went to her lips, pressing them firmly.
She would not have admitted that this action alone
saved her from screaming. After a moment she gave
a little gasp, and located Henry, or rather Henry&rsquo;s
head, which was almost under her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>In the cupboard floor there was a square black hole,
and, just above floor-level, Henry&rsquo;s face looked up at
her, tilted at an odd angle, whilst his one visible hand
manipulated a small electric torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Jane, in a whisper.</p>
<p>She went quickly to the door, locked it, removed the
key, and put it in one of the dressing-table drawers.
She did not know quite what made her do this, only
suddenly when her eyes saw Henry, her mind had a
vivid impression of that long corridor with its one
faintly glimmering light.</p>
<p>Then she sat down on the cupboard floor, close to
Henry&rsquo;s head, and breathed out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry!&mdash;how on earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry, who appeared to be standing upon a ladder
or something equally vertical, came up a few steps, sat
down on the edge of the hole, and switched off his torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to see you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This was my room in
the old days, and Tony and I found this passage. It
leads down to another cupboard in the garden room
where they keep the tennis and croquet gear. How
are you?&mdash;all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Now which of us is going to talk
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had better,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;You see, I
saw Renata, and she told me things, and I think, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, Henry, that I had better tell you everything
that she told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;One minute, Jane,
I just wanted to say, you don&rsquo;t mind talking to me like
this, do you? I wouldn&rsquo;t have asked you to if there
had been any other way&mdash;what I mean to say is....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Jane gave a very small laugh, which was instantly
repressed. She reflected that it was pleasanter to
suppress a laugh than a scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you mean to say is, there aren&rsquo;t any
chaperons in this scene. You needn&rsquo;t apologise,
Henry. Sleuths never have chaperons&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply not
done; and, anyhow, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d make a beautiful
one. Shall I go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be doubted whether Henry really cared about
being described as a chaperon. His tone was rather
dry as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Jane, who had prodded him on purpose just
to see if anything would happen, she certainly felt a
slight disappointment accompanied by a sense of
increased respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw Renata. What did she tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me what she overheard,&rdquo; said Jane,
speaking slowly. &ldquo;Henry, if I tell you what it was,
will you promise me not to let any one guess that you
know? If they were certain that I knew, I shouldn&rsquo;t
be alive to-morrow; and if they thought you knew the
secret, you&rsquo;d never get back to London alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is &lsquo;they,&rsquo; Jane?&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you about Renata first. She really
did walk in her sleep, you know. She must have waked
when she opened the door. She said the first thing she
knew was the cold feel of the hall linoleum under her
feet. The door was open, and she was standing just on
the threshold. There was a screen in front of her, and
beyond the screen a man talking. She heard every
word he said, and I am sure that what she repeated to
me was just exactly what she heard. The first words
that she caught were &lsquo;Formula &ldquo;A.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Henry gave a violent start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. Then he went on, and this is what he said:
&lsquo;You all have Formula &ldquo;A.&rdquo; You will go to your
posts and from your directions you will prepare what
is needful according to that formula, carrying out to
the last detail the cipher instructions which each of
you has received. As soon as the experiments relating
to Formula &ldquo;B&rdquo; are completed, you will receive a
summons in code. You will then assemble at the
rendezvous given, and Formula &ldquo;B,&rdquo; with all instructions
for its employment, will be entrusted to you.
With Formula &ldquo;A&rdquo; you have the key. When
Formula &ldquo;B&rdquo; is also complete you will have the lock
for that key to fit; then the treasures of the world are
yours. The annihilation of civilisation and of the
human race is within our grasp. When the key has
turned in the lock we only shall be left, and....&rsquo;
Just then, Renata said, some one else cried out, &lsquo;The
door! The door!&rsquo; They pushed the screen away
and pulled her in. She nearly fainted. When she
revived a little, her father and Mr. Ember were trying
to find out what she had heard. Fortunately for herself,
she told me, at first it was all confusion. The only
thing that stood out clearly was that shout at the end,
but afterwards, when she was alone, it all came back.
She said it was like a photographic plate developing,
hazy at first, and then everything getting clearer and
sharper until each detail came out. She repeated the
whole thing as if it were a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;My head&rsquo;s going round. I
want to sort things out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Jane waited. She had been prepared for Henry to
be impressed or incredulous. What took her by surprise
was the puzzled note in his voice. &ldquo;Lord, what
a mix-up!&rdquo; she heard him say.</p>
<p>Then he addressed her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever play &lsquo;Russian Scandal,&rsquo; Jane?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. But if you had heard Renata&mdash;the
sort of queer mechanical way she spoke, exactly
like a gramophone record&mdash;why, the words weren&rsquo;t
words she&rsquo;d have used, and all that about Formula
&lsquo;A&rsquo;&mdash;do you think that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that a
schoolgirl makes up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Henry unexpectedly. &ldquo;I think it is
quite possible that she overheard something about
Formula &lsquo;A,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;d give a good deal to know just
what she did hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you what she heard,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;Jimmy always said I had a photographic memory,
and I said the whole thing over to myself until I
had it by heart. You see, I didn&rsquo;t dare to write it
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you say it again?&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
get it down in black and white, and have a look at it.
At present it makes me feel giddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t write it down,&rdquo; said Jane breathlessly.
&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t, Henry! It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry turned on his torch, propped it against the
wall, and produced a notebook and a pencil. The
cold, narrow beam of light showed his knee, the white
paper, a pencil with a silver ring, and Henry&rsquo;s large,
brown hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a <i>horribly</i> determined hand,&rdquo; thought Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;will you start at the beginning
and say it all over again, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane did so meekly, but her inward feelings were not
meek. Once more she repeated, word for word, and
sentence for sentence, the somewhat flamboyant speech
of Number Four.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s hand travelled backwards and forwards in
the little lane of light, and, word for word, and sentence
by sentence, he wrote it down. When he had
finished, he read over what he had written. If he had
not a photographic memory, he was, at any rate,
aware that Jane in her repetition had not varied so
much as a syllable from her first statement.</p>
<p>He went on looking at what he had written. At
last he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, I think I must tell you something in confidence.
Sir William, as you know, is conducting
important experiments for the Government. How
important you may perhaps have gathered from the
extraordinary precautions which are taken to prevent
any leakage of information. These experiments have
resulted in two valuable discoveries represented, for
purposes of official correspondence, by the terms
Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; and Formula &lsquo;B.&rsquo; Within the last
week we have had indisputable proof that Formula
&lsquo;A&rsquo; has been offered to a foreign power. That is the
reason for my presence here. Now these are facts.
Let them sink into your mind, then read over what I
have just taken down, and tell me how you square
those facts with Renata&rsquo;s statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane picked up the notebook, stared at the written
words, set Henry&rsquo;s facts in the forefront of her mind,
and remarked candidly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does make your head go round rather, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry assented. They both sat silent. Then Jane
put down the notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about our heads going round,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Let me go on and tell you the rest of it. It isn&rsquo;t only
what Renata heard; it&rsquo;s the things that keep happening&mdash;little
things in a way, but oh, Henry, sometimes I
think they are more frightening just because they are
little things. I mean, supposing you know you&rsquo;re
going to be executed, you brace yourself up, and it&rsquo;s
all in the day&rsquo;s work, but if you are out at a dinner-party
and you suddenly find poison in the soup, or a
bomb in the middle of the table decorations, it&rsquo;s ...
well, it&rsquo;s unexpected&mdash;and, and <i>perfectly beastly</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s voice broke just for an instant.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s hand came quickly through the torchlight,
and rested on both hers. It was a satisfactorily large
and heavy hand.</p>
<p>She told him about her interview with Ember at the
flat, and one by one she marshalled all the small happenings
which had startled and alarmed her.</p>
<p>Henry waited until she had quite finished. Then he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This lip-reading&mdash;you know, my dear girl, it&rsquo;s a
chancy sort of thing; it seems to me that there are
unlimited possibilities of mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some people are much easier to read from than
others. Lady Heritage is very easy. I&rsquo;m sure I was not
mistaken; she was saying, &lsquo;If she overheard anything,
would she have the intelligence to be dangerous?
That is what I ask myself,&rsquo; and she said, &lsquo;Despise not
thine enemy,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Anything but Formula &ldquo;A.&rdquo;&rsquo;
Now Mr. Ember is very difficult. I can&rsquo;t really make
him out at all. His lips don&rsquo;t move. It&rsquo;s no use
not believing me, Henry. Look here, I&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught up the little torch, and turned the light
upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say something,&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s lips formed the words, &ldquo;Jane, I love you
very much indeed&rdquo;&mdash;and Jane switched off the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, you&rsquo;re a perfect beast! Play fair,&rdquo; she
said, in a low, furious whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. Wasn&rsquo;t it all right? Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane allowed the ray to light up Henry&rsquo;s mouth and
chin. The hand that held the torch was not quite
steady. This may have been the result of anger&mdash;or
of some other emotion. As a result the light wavered
a good deal.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s lips moved, and Jane read aloud, &ldquo;A sleuth
should never lose its temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s hand caught the little shaking one that held
the torch, and gave it a great squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How frightfully clever you are, and&mdash;oh, Jane,
what a goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see that, with Renata&rsquo;s story in
your mind, you would be looking out for things?
You couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, then, of Lady Heritage saying
that Mr. Ember&rsquo;s verdict was inclined to be &lsquo;Guilty,
but recommended to mercy,&rsquo; whereas she said that she
herself doubted the guilt, but that if she did not, she
would have no mercy at all? Do you know, that
frightened me almost more than anything. I don&rsquo;t
know why. That wasn&rsquo;t lip-reading; I heard the
words with my own ears.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
back to facts: Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; has been stolen and
offered for sale. Renata, undoubtedly, overheard
something relating to Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo; Now, supposing
Mr. Molloy or one of his friends to be the person who
is doing the deal, don&rsquo;t you see that the possibility
of Renata having overheard something compromising
would be sufficient to account for a good deal of
alarm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Molloy and his friends had stolen Formula
&lsquo;A&rsquo; and were trying to dispose of it, it would naturally
be of the highest importance to them to find out how
much Renata knew, and to take steps which would
ensure her silence. They would almost certainly try
and frighten her&mdash;that&rsquo;s how it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where does Mr. Ember come in?&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;He was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata described him,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;She said he
was the worst of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew him by name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But ... but&rdquo;&mdash;a little chill breath of
doubt played on Jane&rsquo;s certainty&mdash;&ldquo;she called him the
man in the fur coat. The others spoke of him as
Number Two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know that it was Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Jane felt that she was sure of nothing;
then, with a swift revulsion, her old fears, suspicions,
certainties, received vigorous reinforcement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;listen. You&rsquo;re on the wrong
scent&mdash;I know you are. I can&rsquo;t tell you how I know it,
but I&rsquo;m quite, quite sure. If you were an anarchist,
and wanted to produce some horrible thing that would
smash civilisation into atoms, how would you set
about it?&mdash;where would you go? Don&rsquo;t you see that
the very safest place would be somewhere like this,
somewhere where you could carry on your experiments
under the cover of real experiments? It&rsquo;s like
the caterpillars that pretend to be sticks&mdash;what do
you call it?&mdash;protective mimicry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what they have done. I&rsquo;m sure
that there is something dreadful going on in this
house. And if you can&rsquo;t square what Renata heard
with what you know of Formula &lsquo;A,&rsquo; why, then I
believe that there must be more than one Formula
&lsquo;A.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you see how cunning it would be for them
to take the name of a real Government invention to
cover up whatever horrible thing it is that they are
working at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Henry slowly. Then,
with an abrupt change of manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it&mdash;all of it&mdash;and tell me some things I want
to know. Sir William, for instance&mdash;he was put out
at my coming down, I know&mdash;but what is he like as a
rule? He does not always drink as much as he did
to-night, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he does. Henry, I think he takes too
much&mdash;I do, really; and he&rsquo;s frightfully irritable. But
that&rsquo;s not what strikes me most. The thing I notice
is that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to do any work. Mr. Ember
is supposed to be his secretary, but he really does all
his work with Lady Heritage. She goes on all the
time. She spends hours in the laboratories. I believe
she works there till ever so late, but Sir William just
sticks in his study and broods. I thought how strange
it was from the very first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lady Heritage? Put all this mysterious
business on one side and tell me what you make of
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s disturbing. I think she has too
much of everything, and it seems to upset the balance
of everything she touches. She&rsquo;s too beautiful for
one thing, and she has too much intellect, and too
much, far too much, emotion. I think she is dreadfully
unhappy too, with the sort of unhappiness that makes
you want to hurt somebody else. You know what
she sang this evening. I think she really feels like
that, and would like to smash&mdash;everything. That&rsquo;s
why....&rdquo; Jane broke off suddenly; her voice dropped
to the least possible thread, &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s that&mdash;what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, her hand met Henry&rsquo;s on the switch of
the torch. The light went out. Jane clung to one
of the hard, strong fingers as she listened with all her
ears. She heard a footstep, light and unmistakable,
and it stopped upon the threshold.</p>
<p>There were about twenty seconds of really terrifying
silence, and then the handle of the door turned slowly.
Jane heard the creak of the hinge, the minute rattle
of the latch. Then the handle was released, but slowly
and with the least possible noise. There was another
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Jane pinched Henry as hard as she could, and though
this, of course, relieved the strain she felt dreadfully
afraid that she would scream unless something broke
through this dreadful quiet.</p>
<p>Something did break through it next moment, for
there came a low knocking on the door, and with the
first sound of that knocking Jane recovered herself.
With an extraordinary quickness and lightness she was
on her feet and out of the cupboard, the cupboard was
shut, and Jane, her shoes noiselessly discarded, was
sitting on the side of a rumpled bed, a fold of the sheet
across her mouth, inquiring in sleepy, muffled accents:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knocking had gone on steadily. Now it stopped,
and a voice said, &ldquo;It is I, Lady Heritage. Open the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane threw back the bedclothes so as to cover the
chair at the bed-foot&mdash;a chair upon which there should
have been a neatly folded pile of clothes&mdash;pulled off
her stockings, and took the key out of the dressing-table
drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; she said, and fumbled at the lock.</p>
<p>Next moment the door was open, and she saw Lady
Heritage in her white linen overall and head-dress,
the latter pushed back and showing her hair.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage saw a startled girl in a red flannel
dressing-gown. Between the moonlight and the light
from the passage there was a sort of dusk. Lady
Heritage put her hand on the switch, but did not pull
it down. Instead, she said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a light under the door. Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Raymond crossed the room quickly and felt each of
the electric bulbs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;A light?&rdquo; said Jane again.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage went back to the door and turned
all the lights on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always lock yourself in?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
why did you take the key out of the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it wrong? They say that if you lock your
door and put the key away, even if you walk in your
sleep, you don&rsquo;t go out of the room. I shouldn&rsquo;t like
to walk in my sleep in a big house like this, and perhaps
wake up in a cellar or out on the terrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage did an odd thing. Something flashed
across her face as Jane was speaking, and she put both
hands on the girl&rsquo;s shoulders and pulled her round so
that she faced the light.</p>
<p>Jane met, for a moment, a most extraordinary look.
It did not seem to go through her as Mr. Ember&rsquo;s
scrutiny had done, but it shook her more. She looked
down and said shakily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Oh, please tell me if I have vexed
you&mdash;oh, please....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage took her hands away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten you walked in your sleep,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like locked doors as a rule, but I suppose
you had better keep yours fastened. I shouldn&rsquo;t
like you to walk into the sea and get drowned, or break
your neck falling off the terrace. Get back to your
bed. I&rsquo;m just going to mine. I&rsquo;ve been working late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went out, and it was a long, long time before
Jane, who had heard the soft footfalls die away in the
distance, dared open the door and take a hasty look
along the corridor. It was quite empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>After another pause she went to the cupboard door
and opened it. The flooring stretched unbroken;
there was no square hole, and no Henry. She sat down
on the floor, hesitated, and then knocked lightly.</p>
<p>Under her very hand a board rose with a little
jerk&mdash;a line of light showed, and Henry&rsquo;s voice said
softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, be quick, I daren&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She said she saw a light. Henry,
she frightens me, she really does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The board rose a little higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sleuth who gets frightened is no earthly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
said Henry firmly. &ldquo;Now look here, Jane, I can get
you out of this quite easily if you want to come. You
are the only person in the house whom I haven&rsquo;t interviewed.
Mr. Ember said that of course I shouldn&rsquo;t
want to see you, as you did not get here until after the
leakage must have taken place. I made no comment
at the time, but it is perfectly open to me to insist on
seeing you, to say that I am not satisfied with the
interview, and to take you back to London for further
interrogation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry had opened the trap door about a foot. His
face, lighted from below, looked very odd with the
chin almost resting on a board at Jane&rsquo;s feet and the
trap held up by one hand and only just clearing his
hair. Jane would have wanted to laugh if his last
suggestion had appalled her less.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you do that, it&rsquo;s
all up. Mr. Ember would never, never, never, allow
you to interview me. He&rsquo;d be afraid of what I might
say, and he&rsquo;d find some awful way of keeping me quiet.
As to letting me go off to London with you, well, if
we started we&rsquo;d certainly never get there. And oh,
Henry, please, please go away. I&rsquo;m sure they suspect
something, and if she comes again, or if he comes&mdash;oh,
Henry, do go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Now, Jane, look here.
I&rsquo;m off before breakfast, but I can make an excuse to
come down at any time if you want me. If anything
is going wrong, or you get frightened, or if you want
to get out of it write for patterns of jumper wool to
the Misses Kent, Hermione Street, South Kensington.
It&rsquo;s a real wool shop and they&rsquo;ll send you real patterns,
but Miss Kent will ring me up the minute she gets
your letter. I&rsquo;ll come down straight away, and you
look out for me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;ll come and stay? Won&rsquo;t they
suspect something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me
why, but send for me if you want me, and be very sure
that I shall come. Got that address all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a preliminary to going, Henry came up a step
higher, set the torch on the floor, and took Jane by
the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get frightened, Jane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hate
you to be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, not really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry came up another step; the trap now rested on
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Henry, <i>please</i>....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Henry. He continued to hold
Jane&rsquo;s hand and appeared immovable. Jane could
of course have taken her hand away and left the cupboard,
but this did not occur to her till afterwards.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly Henry kissed her wrist, and a piece
of the red flannel cuff. The next minute he was really
gone. Perhaps it had occurred to him that he was a
chaperon.</p>
<p>Jane lay awake for a long time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span></h2>
<p>Henry went away by an early train, and Jane
came down to what, as a child, she had once
described as a crumpled kind of day. She remembered
&ldquo;darling Jimmy&rdquo; looking at her in a vague
way, and saying in his gentle, cultivated voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crumpled, my dear Jane? What do you mean
by crumpled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jane, frowning and direct:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean a thing that&rsquo;s got crumps in it, Jimmy
darling,&rdquo; and when Mr. Carruthers did not appear to
find this a sufficient explanation, she had burst into
emphatic elucidation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was cross, and Nurse was cross, and you were
cross. Yes, you were, and I had only just opened
the study door ever so little; and I didn&rsquo;t mean to
upset the milk or to break the soap-dish; and oh,
Jimmy, you must know what a crump is, and this
day has been just chock-full of them. That&rsquo;s why I
said it was crumpled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day of Henry&rsquo;s departure was undoubtedly a
crumpled day. To start with, a letter from Mr.
Molloy awaited Jane at the breakfast table. It
began, &ldquo;My dear Renata,&rdquo; and was signed, &ldquo;Your
affectionate father, Cornelius R. Molloy.&rdquo; Mr. Ember
remarked at once upon the unusual circumstance of
there being a letter for Miss Molloy, and Jane, acting
on an impulse which she afterwards regretted, replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my father. Do you want to see what he
says?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jeffrey Ember. He glanced
casually at the bald sentences in which Mr. Molloy
hoped that his daughter was well, and expressed
dislike of the climatic conditions which he had encountered
on the voyage. His eyes rested for a moment
upon the signature, and quite suddenly he cast a
bombshell at Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the &lsquo;R&rsquo; stand for?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jane had the worst moment of panic with which
her adventure had yet provided her. She was about
to say that she did not know, and take the consequences,
when Mr. Ember saved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Renatus?&rdquo; he asked. Jane broke into
voluble speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my name has nothing to do
with his. I was called Renata after an aunt, my
mother&rsquo;s twin sister. They were exactly alike and
devoted to each other, and I was called after my
Aunt Renata, and her only daughter was called after
my mother.&rdquo; Here Jane bit the tip of her tongue
and stopped, but she had not stopped in time. Mr.
Ember&rsquo;s eyes had left Molloy&rsquo;s signature and were
fixed upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; faltered Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you and your cousin as much alike as
your mothers were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane stared at her plate. She stared so hard that
the gilt rim seemed to detach itself and float like a
nimbus above a half-finished slice of buttered toast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember
my mother, and I never saw my aunt.&rdquo;
Once again she bit her tongue, and this time very hard
indeed. She had been within an ace of saying, &ldquo;My
Aunt Jane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have seen your cousin; by the way, what
is her surname?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith&mdash;Jane Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen your cousin, Jane Smith? Are you
alike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only seen her once.&rdquo; Jane grasped her
courage, and looked straight at Mr. Ember. He either
knew something, or this was just idle teasing. In
either case being afraid would not serve her. A spice
of humour might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re frightfully interested in my aunts and
cousins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you want to find another
secretary just like me for some one? But I&rsquo;m afraid
my Cousin Jane isn&rsquo;t available. She&rsquo;s married to a
man in Bolivia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Lady Heritage looked over the edge of
<i>The Times</i> with a frown, and the conversation dropped.
Jane finished her buttered toast, and admired herself
because her hand did not shake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Lady Heritage seemed to be in a frowning mood.
This, it appeared, was not one of the days when she disappeared
behind the steel grating with Ember, leaving
Jane to pursue her appointed tasks in the library.
Instead, there was a general sorting of correspondence
and checking of work already done, with the result that
Jane found herself being played upon, as it were, by a
jet or spray of hot water. The temperature varied,
but the spray was continuous. A letter to which Lady
Heritage particularly wished to refer was not to be
found, a package of papers wrongly addressed had
come back through the Dead Letter Office, and an unanswered
invitation was discovered in the &ldquo;Answered&rdquo;
file. By three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon Jane had been
made to feel that it was possible that the world might
contain a person duller, more inept, and less competent
than herself&mdash;possible, but not probable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better go for a walk, Miss
Molloy,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage; &ldquo;perhaps some fresh
air....&rdquo; She did not finish the sentence, and Jane, only
too thankful to escape, made haste from the presence.</p>
<p>Ember had been right when he said that the grounds
were extensive.</p>
<p>Jane skirted the house and made her way through a
space of rather formally kept garden to where a gravel
path followed the edge of the cliff. For a time it was
bordered by veronica and fuchsia bushes, but after a
while these ceased and left the bare down with its
rather coarse grass, tiny growing plants, tangled
brambles, and bright yellow clumps of gorse. The path
went up and down. Sometimes it almost overhung the
sea. Always a tall hedge of barbed wire straggled
across the view and spoilt it.</p>
<p>The fact that a powerful electric current ran through
the wire and made it dangerous to touch added to the
dislike with which she regarded it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>It was a grey afternoon with a whipping wind from
the north-west that beat up little crests of foam on the
lead-coloured waves and made Jane clutch at her hat
every now and then. She thought it cold when she
started, but by and by she began to enjoy the sense of
motion, the wind&rsquo;s buffets, and the wide, clear outlook.
At the farthest point of the headland she stopped,
warm and glowing. The path ran out to the edge of
the cliff. On the landward side the rock rose sharply,
naked of grass, and heaped with rough boulders. A
small cave or hollow ran inwards for perhaps four feet.
In front of it, in fact almost within it, stood a stone
bench pleasantly sheltered by the overhanging rock
and curving sides of the hollow. Jane felt no need of
shelter. Instead of sitting down, she climbed upon
the back of the bench and, steadying herself against
a rock, looked out over the wire and saw how the cliff
fell away, sheer at first, and then in a series of jagged,
tumbled steps until the rocks went down into the sea.</p>
<p>After a time Jane scrambled down and was hesitating
as to whether she would turn or not when a sound
attracted her attention.</p>
<p>The path ended by the stone bench, but there seemed
to be quite a practicable grassy track beyond.</p>
<p>The sound which Jane had heard was the sound
made by a stone which has become displaced on a hillside.
It must have been a very heavy stone. It fell
with a muffled crash. Then came another sound
which she could not place. She looked all round and
could see nothing.</p>
<p>Something frightened her.</p>
<p>All at once she realised that she was a long way from
the house and quite out of sight. Turning quickly, she
began to walk back along the way that she had come,
but she had not gone a dozen paces before she heard
scrambling footsteps behind her. Looking over her
shoulder, she saw the man George Patterson standing
beside the stone seat which she had just left. He made
some sort of beckoning sign with his hand and called
out, but a puff of wind took away the words, and only a
hoarse, and as she thought, threatening sound reached
her ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Without waiting to hear or see any more she began
to run, and with the first flying step that she took there
came upon her a blind, driving panic which sent her
racing down the path as one races in a nightmare.</p>
<p>George Patterson started in pursuit. He called
again twice, and the sound of his voice was a whip to
Jane&rsquo;s terror. After at the most a minute he gave up
the chase, and Jane flew on, pursued by nothing worse
than her own fear.</p>
<p>Just by the first fuchsia bush she ran, blind and
panting, into the very arms of Mr. Ember. The impact
nearly knocked him down, and it may be considered as
certain that he was very much taken aback.</p>
<p>Jane came back to a knowledge of her whereabouts
to find herself gripping Mr. Ember&rsquo;s arm and stammering
out that something had frightened her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know,&rdquo; said Jane, half sobbing, but
already conscious that she did not desire to confide in
Jeffrey Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a little gasp Jane let go, and wished ardently
that her knees would stop shaking. Ember looked at
her very curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Jane had often wondered what his queer cold eyes
reminded her of. Curiously enough, it was now, in
the midst of her fright, that she knew. They were
like pebbles&mdash;the greeny-grey ones which lie by the
thousand on the seashore. As a rule they were dull
and hard, just as the pebbles are dull and hard when
they are dry. But sometimes when he was angry,
when he cross-questioned you, or when he looked at
Lady Heritage the dullness vanished and they looked
as the pebbles look when some sudden wave has
touched them. Jane did not know when she disliked
them most.</p>
<p>They brightened slowly now as they fixed themselves
upon her, and Ember said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I was hoping I might meet you.
We haven&rsquo;t had a real talk since you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>Her manner conveyed no ardent desire for conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we walk a little?&rdquo; pursued her companion;
&ldquo;the wind&rsquo;s cold for standing. I really do want to
talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane said nothing at all. If Ember wished to talk,
let him talk. She was still shaky, and not at all in
the mood for fencing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like being here? How do we
strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember spoke quite casually, and Jane thought it
was strange that he and Henry should both have asked
her the same question. Her reply, however, differed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? My dear Miss Renata, what a really
extraordinary number of things you&mdash;don&rsquo;t know!
You don&rsquo;t know what frightened you, and you don&rsquo;t
know whether you like us or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s temper carried her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I do,&rdquo; she said viciously, and looked full
at the bright pebble eyes.</p>
<p>Ember laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of Lady Heritage? Wonderful,
isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the most beautiful
person I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Too beautiful, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she desired to interest Jeffrey Ember, it appeared
that she had succeeded. His attention was certainly
arrested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why too beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane had an impulse towards frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s too ... everything. She has so
many gifts, it does not seem as if there could be scope
for them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember looked at Jane for a moment. Then he looked
away. In that moment Jane saw something&mdash;she could
not really tell what. The nearest that she could get to
it was &ldquo;triumph.&rdquo; Yes, that was it, triumph.</p>
<p>As he looked away he said, very low, &ldquo;She will have
scope enough,&rdquo; and there was a little tingling silence.</p>
<p>He broke it in an utterly unforeseen manner. With
an abrupt change of voice he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever learn chemistry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane, and then wondered whether she
was telling the truth about Renata.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M&mdash;know what a formula is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane put a dash of ignorant conviction into her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think so&mdash;oh yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to explain things, isn&rsquo;t it? Of course
I know &lsquo;formulate,&rsquo; and er&mdash;&lsquo;formal.&rsquo; But it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
something learned, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Ember&rsquo;s sarcastic smile showed for a moment. With
a horrid inward qualm Jane wondered whether she
had overdone Renata&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A formula is a prescription,&rdquo; said Ember slowly.
&ldquo;If you remember that, I think you&rsquo;ll find it all quite
simple. So that Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; is simply a prescription
for making something up, labelled &lsquo;A&rsquo; for convenience&rsquo;
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane let her eyes become quite round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she said in the blankest tone at her command.
&ldquo;But ... but what is Formula &lsquo;A,&rsquo; Mr.
Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my dear Miss Renata, is what a good many
people would like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would they? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would. In fact, some of them&mdash;person or
persons unknown&mdash;wanted to know so much that
they have gone to the length of stealing Formula
&lsquo;A.&rsquo; That, at least, is Captain March&rsquo;s opinion, and
the reason for his visit here. So I should be careful,
very careful indeed, about betraying any knowledge of
Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane whisked round, stared blankly, and said in
largest capitals:</p>
<p>&ldquo;ME?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after a pause, she burst out laughing. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You either know, or you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Jeffrey
Ember. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not going to tell
you. If you do, I have just given you a warning. A
very valuable Government secret has been stolen, and
if Captain March were to suspect that you were in any
way involved&mdash;well, I suppose ... I need not tell you
that the consequences would be serious beyond words.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Jane gazed at him in a breathless delight which she
hoped was not apparent. The day had been singularly
lacking in pleasantness, but it was undoubtedly pleasing
to receive a solemn warning of the dreadful fate
that might overtake her if Henry should suspect that
she knew anything about Formula &ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea what Formula
&lsquo;A&rsquo; can be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It sounds frightfully exciting.
Do tell me some more. Was it stolen? And how
could anything be stolen here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who frightened you?&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>Jane caught her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a stone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why
it frightened me so. It fell over the edge of the cliff
and gave me a horrid nightmare-ish sort of feeling. I
started running and then I couldn&rsquo;t stop. It was
frightfully stupid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on a few paces. Then Ember said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain March will probably come down here
again. I managed to save you from an interview
with him this time, but if he comes again, and if he
sees you, remember there is only one safe way for
you&mdash;you know nothing, you never have known
anything, as far as you are concerned there is nothing
to know. You shouldn&rsquo;t find that difficult. You
have quite a talent for not knowing things. Improve
it.&rdquo; He paused, smiled slightly, and went on, &ldquo;You
said just now that it was frightfully stupid of you
to be frightened. Sometimes, Miss Renata, it is a
great deal more stupid not to be frightened. Believe
me, this is one of those times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked home in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span></h2>
<p>Whilst Jane was running away from fear,
down the gravel path of the cliff&rsquo;s edge, Captain
March was about midway through an interview
with his chief.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s chief was a large man who strongly resembled
a clean and highly intelligent pig. A very little
hair appeared to grow reluctantly on his head; his face
was pink and clean-shaven. He had inherited the
patronymic of Le Mesurier, his parents in his baptism
had given him the romantic name of Julian, and a
grateful Government had conferred upon him the honour
of knighthood. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add
that, from the moment that he emerged from the
nursery and set foot within the precincts of his first
preparatory school, he had been known exclusively as
&ldquo;Piggy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>There is a story of a d&eacute;butante who, at a large and
formal dinner-party, was discovered during a sudden
silence to be addressing him as Sir Piggott. The dinner-party
waited breathlessly. Piggy smiled his benign
smile and explained that it had not been his good fortune
to be called after his aunt, Miss Piggott.... &ldquo;I
expect you have heard of her? She left all her money
to a home for cats, whereas, if my parents had done
their duty and invited her to be my godmother, I
should be paying at least twice as much income tax as
I do now. Never undervalue your relations, my dear
Miss Browne.&rdquo; The aunt was, of course, apocryphal;
and after dinner each of the older ladies in turn took
the d&eacute;butante aside, and told her so&mdash;as a kindness.
To each of them she made the same reply, which was
to the effect that &ldquo;Piggy&rdquo; was a darling. She married
him two years later. But all this has nothing to do
with Henry&rsquo;s interview with his chief.</p>
<p>Sir Julian was speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unsatisfactory. You say they have been
complying with all the suggestions in the original
Government instructions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Julian frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unsatisfactory,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Sir
William ... well, it&rsquo;s six months since I saw him, and
he looked all right then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks all right now,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;He is all
right except on his own particular subject. He&rsquo;d
discuss politics, unemployment, foreign affairs, or
anything else, and you wouldn&rsquo;t notice anything, but
the minute he comes to his own subject everything
worries and irritates him. He&rsquo;s lost grip. As far as
I can make out, he leaves everything to his daughter
and the secretary. They are competent enough,
but....&rdquo; Henry did not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, the secretary,&rdquo; said Sir Julian. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
his name? Yes, Ember, Jeffrey Ember....&rdquo; He
turned an indicator under his hand, and spoke rapidly
into the telephone beside him. &ldquo;As soon as possible,&rdquo;
he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl now,&rdquo; he said, looking at Henry. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see how this statement of hers can be squared
with any of the facts as we know them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>As he spoke he picked up the notes which Henry had
taken in the dark cupboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made a suggestion herself,&rdquo; said Henry. He
paused, and looked with a good deal of diffidence at
Sir Julian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just within the bounds of possibility that the
Government experiments are being used as a blind.
That was her suggestion, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Julian was busily engaged in drawing on his
blotting-paper. He drew in rapid succession cats with
arched backs and bottle-brush tails, always beginning
with the tail and finishing with the whiskers, three on
each side. Henry rightly interpreted this as a sign that
he was to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conversation which was overheard at Molloy&rsquo;s
flat referred to a Formula &lsquo;A,&rsquo; which cannot possibly
be the Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; which we know. There may
be a Formula &lsquo;A&rsquo; of which we know nothing, and it
may constitute a grave danger. Ember&rdquo;&mdash;Henry
paused&mdash;&ldquo;Ember is not only in a position of great
responsibility with regard to our&mdash;the official Formula
&lsquo;A,&rsquo; but he also appears to be mixed up with this other
unofficial and possibly dangerous Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo; The
question, to my mind, is, &lsquo;What about Ember?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Julian continued to draw cats. Suddenly he
looked up, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has Patterson been there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortnight,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;We recalled Jamieson,
you remember, and sent him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if there were unofficial experiments, they
would be before his time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be possible&mdash;no, I&rsquo;ll put it another way.
Officially Luttrell Marches is impregnable, but unofficially&mdash;come
March, the place practically belongs
to you&mdash;is there any way in which there might be
coming and going that would defy detection? You
see, your hypothesis demands either wholesale corruption
of Government workmen, or the introduction of
other experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then Henry said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In confidence, sir, there <i>is</i> a way, but, to the best
of my knowledge, it is known only to myself and one
other person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. It never has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I would suggest your ascertaining, in conjunction
with the other person, whether there is any
evidence to show that the secret has been discovered
and the way made use of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang. Sir Julian lifted the
receiver and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then he began to take
notes. &ldquo;Spell the name, please&mdash;yes. Nineteen
hundred and five? Is that all? Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver, and turned to Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ember&rsquo;s dossier,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not much in it at
first sight. &lsquo;Born 1880. Son of Charles Ember,
partner in Jarvis &amp; Ember&mdash;manufacturing chemists;
firm liquidated in 1896. Education till then at
Harrow, and subsequently at Heidelberg, where he
took degrees in medicine and science. From 1905
to 1912 at Chicago, U. S. A., as personal assistant to
Eugene K. Blumfield of Nitrates Ltd. Engaged as
secretary by Sir William Carr-Magnus during his
American tour in autumn of 1912. Total exemption
during War on Sir William&rsquo;s representations.&rsquo; &rsquo;M&mdash;blameless
as a blancmange&mdash;at first sight. We
wouldn&rsquo;t have him here at all if we hadn&rsquo;t been told
to get the record of every one employed at Luttrell
Marches. Well, March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry looked up with his candid, diffident air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heidelberg&mdash;Chicago&mdash;nitrates,&rdquo; he said, with a
little pause after each word. Then&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if it
was in Chicago that he met Molloy. Molloy was a
leading light of the I. W. W. there in 1911.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piggy looked up for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you get on to the subject
of Molloy at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to be very careful,&rdquo; said Henry, with a
worried air. &ldquo;I was introduced to Miss Molloy, so I
felt that it would look odd if I asked no questions. On
the other hand, I was afraid of asking too many. You
see, sir, if there&rsquo;s really some infernal, underground
plot going on, with the general smash-up of civilisation
as its object, that girl is in a most awfully dangerous
position. I wish to Heaven she was out of it, but I&rsquo;m
not at all sure that she isn&rsquo;t right when she says that
the most dangerous thing of all would be for her to
give the show away by bolting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M, yes,&rdquo; said Piggy. &ldquo;Your concern for the
young lady&rsquo;s safety does you credit&mdash;attractive
damsel in distress, eh? Nice, pretty young thing,
and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry blushed furiously, and said with some stiffness,
&ldquo;As I told you, sir, we are old friends, and I
think, it&rsquo;s natural&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely, entirely.&rdquo; Piggy waved a large, fat
hand with a pencil in it. &ldquo;But to get back to Ember&mdash;what
did you ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I said I had known one or two Molloys, and
asked whether Miss Molloy was the cricketer&rsquo;s daughter.
Ember was quite forthcoming, rather too forthcoming,
I thought. Said he&rsquo;d met Molloy in the States, and
that he was a queer card, but good company. Explained
how surprised he was when he ran into him at Victoria
Station after not seeing him for years. Then, quite
casually and naturally, gave me to understand that
Molloy had put him up for a couple of nights. He
really did it very well. Said the daughter was a nice
little thing just from school, that he thought she would
suit Lady Heritage, and how grateful Molloy was,
as he was just off to the States, and didn&rsquo;t know what
to do with the girl. The impression I got was that he
was taking no chances&mdash;not leaving anything for me to
find out afterwards.&rdquo; Henry hesitated for a moment,
and then said, &ldquo;The thing that struck me most was
this. I didn&rsquo;t ask to interview Miss Molloy because I
didn&rsquo;t want to make her position more dangerous than
it already is. That is to say, I assumed that there
<i>was</i> danger, which really means assuming a criminal
conspiracy. Now, if there were no danger and no
criminal conspiracy, why on earth did every one make
it so easy for me not to interview Miss Molloy? It
seems a little thing, but it struck me&mdash;it struck me
awfully, sir. You see, I took a roll-call of the employ&eacute;s
first, and checked them by the official list. Then I
went down to the stables with Sir William, and we
went through all the outdoor servants. And I finished
up in Sir William&rsquo;s study, where I saw the domestic
staff&mdash;and Mr. Ember. From first to last, no one
suggested that I should see Miss Molloy. In the end,
I thought it would be too marked not to bring her in
at all, so I said to Lady Heritage, &lsquo;What about your
secretary?&rsquo; and she said, &lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;s only just come
... you don&rsquo;t need to see her.&rsquo; I got nervous and
left it at that. I think now that I ought to have seen
her, with Lady Heritage and Ember in the room; then
they couldn&rsquo;t have suspected her of telling me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Piggy looked up from his cats, and looked down
again. Very carefully he gave each cat a fourth
whisker on the left-hand side. Then he fixed his
small, light eyes on Henry and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>At 9.30 that evening Sir Julian marked a place in
his book with a massive thumb, glanced across the
domestic hearth at his wife, and observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Le Mesurier raised her charming blue eyes
from the child&rsquo;s frock which she was embroidering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have news to break to you&mdash;news concerning the
lad Henry. Prepare for a shock. He is another&rsquo;s.
You have lost him, my poor Isobel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had him,&rdquo; said Isobel placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mamma thought you had. She did her very
best to warn me. I rather think she considered that
your young affections were also entangled. I said to
her solemnly, &lsquo;My dear Mrs. March&mdash;I beg your
pardon&mdash;my dear Mrs. <i>de Luttrelle</i> March&mdash;of course
he is in love with Isobel. I expect young men to be in
love with her. I am in love with her myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy, you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, m&rsquo; dear, but I should have liked to. She is so
very large and pink that the temptation to say it, and
to watch the pink turn puce, was almost more than I
could resist. But you have interrupted me. I was
about to break to you a portentous fact. Our Henry
is in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Piggy!&rdquo; said Isobel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Henry&rsquo;s chief&mdash;&ldquo;Henry is undoubtedly
for it. Another lost soul. It&rsquo;s always these
promising lads that are snatched by the predatory sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy&mdash;we&rsquo;re not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; dear, you <i>are</i>. It&rsquo;s axiomatic, beyond cavil or
argument. Like the python in the natural history
books, you fascinate us first, and then engulf us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isobel allowed a fleeting smile to lift the corners of
her very pretty mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Piggy, what a mouthful you would be!&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; pursued Sir Julian&mdash;&ldquo;Henry is in the
fascinated stage. He blushed one of the most modestly
revealing blushes I have ever beheld. The whole
story is of the most thrillingly romantic and intriguing
nature, and I regret to say, m&rsquo; dear, that I cannot tell
you a single word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Le Mesurier took up a blue silk thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Piggy!&rdquo; she said reproachfully.</p>
<p>Sir Julian beamed upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My official duty forbids,&rdquo; he said, with great enjoyment.
&ldquo;Dismiss the indecent curiosity which I see
stamped upon your every feature. Upon Henry&rsquo;s
affair my lips are sealed. I am a tomb. I merely wish
to have a small bet with you as to whether Henry&rsquo;s
mamma will queer his pitch or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Piggy darling, how can I lay odds if I don&rsquo;t
know anything? Tell me, is she pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isobel, is that the spirit in which to approach this
solemn subject? As an old married woman, you
should ask, Is she virtuous? Is she thrifty? Is she
worthy of Henry? And to all these questions I should
make the same reply&mdash;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isobel leaned forward, and still with that faint,
delightful smile she pricked the back of Sir Julian&rsquo;s
hand sharply with the point of her embroidery needle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The serpent&rsquo;s tooth!&rdquo; he said, and opened his
book. &ldquo;Isobel, you interrupt my studies. I merely
wish to commend three aspects of the case to your
feminine intuition. First&mdash;Henry is in love; second&mdash;he
has yet to reckon with his mamma; third&mdash;I may
at any time ring you up and instruct you to prepare the
guest chamber for Henry&rsquo;s girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Le Mesurier began to work a blue ribbon bow
round the stalks of some pink and white daisies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather a lamb, Piggy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span></h2>
<p>It was next morning, whilst Jane was sorting and
arranging the papers for the library table, that she
caught sight of Henry&rsquo;s first message. She very nearly
missed it, for the fold of the paper cut right across
the agony column, and what caught her eye was the
one word that passed as a signature, &ldquo;Thursday.&rdquo; It
startled her so much that she dropped the paper, and,
in snatching at it, knocked over a pile of magazines.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage looked over her shoulder with a
frown, tapped with her foot, and then went on with
her writing in a silence that uttered more reproof
than words could have done.</p>
<p>Jane picked everything up as silently as possible.
As she put the papers on the table, she laid <i>The Times</i>
out flat, and, bending over it, read the message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will receive a letter from me. Trust the
bearer. Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put all the papers neatly in their places, and went
to her writing-table with an intense longing to be alone,
to be able to think what this might mean, and to wonder
who&mdash;who would be the bearer of Henry&rsquo;s letter.
She hoped ardently that Lady Heritage would have
business in the laboratories, and whilst these thoughts,
and hopes, and wonderings filled her mind, she had to
write neat and legible replies to the apparently inexhaustible
number of persons who desired Lady Heritage
to open bazaars, speak at public meetings, subscribe to
an indefinite number of charities, or contribute to the
writer&rsquo;s support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>When, at last, she was alone in her own room, she
was tingling with excitement. At any moment some
one, some unknown friend and ally, might present
himself. It was exciting, but, she thought, rather
risky.</p>
<p>For instance, supposing Henry&rsquo;s letter came, by any
mischance, into the wrong hands&mdash;and letters were
mislaid and stolen sometimes&mdash;what a perfectly dreadful
chapter of misfortunes might ensue. She frowned,
and decided that Henry had been rash.</p>
<p>It was with a pleasant feeling of superiority that she
put on her hat and went out into the garden to pick
tulips.</p>
<p>The weather had changed in the night, and it was
hot and sunny, with the sudden dazzling heat of mid-April.
In the walled garden the south border was full
of violet-scented yellow tulips, each looking at this
new hot sun with a jet-black eye. A sheet of forget-me-nots
repeated the sheer blue of the sky.</p>
<p>Jane picked an armful of tulips and a sheaf of
leopard&rsquo;s bane. Strictly speaking, she should then have
gone in to put the flowers in water for the adornment
of the Yellow Drawing-Room. Instead, she made her
way to the farthest corner of the garden and basked.</p>
<p>At first she looked at the flowers, but after a while
her eyelids fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Jane has never admitted that she went to sleep, but,
if she was thinking with her eyes shut, her thoughts
must have been of an extremely engrossing nature, for
it is certain that she heard neither the opening nor the
shutting of a door in the wall beside her. She did feel
a shadow pass between herself and the sun, and opening
her eyes quickly she saw standing beside her the
very man from whom she had fled in terror yesterday.</p>
<p>The sunlight fell from upon him, showing the shabby
clothes, the tall, stooping figure, the grizzled beard,
and that disfiguring scar.</p>
<p>With a great start Jane attempted to rise, only to
discover that a wheelbarrow may make a very comfortable
chair, but that it is uncommonly difficult to get
out of in a hurry. To her horror the man, George
Patterson, took her firmly by the wrist and pulled her
to her feet. She shrank intensely from his touch,
received an impression of unusual strength, and then,
to her overwhelming surprise, she heard him say in a
low, well-bred voice, &ldquo;I have a letter for you, Miss
Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; said Jane&mdash;&ldquo;oh, please, hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t do it again. Look here, I want
to say a few words to you, but we had better not be
seen together. Here&rsquo;s your letter. Stay where you
are for five minutes, and then come down to the
potting-shed. Don&rsquo;t come in; stay by the door and
tie your shoe-lace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went off with his dragging step, and left Jane
dumb. There was a folded note in her hand, and in
her mind so intense a shock of surprise as to rob her
very thoughts of expression.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a long paralysed month, she
opened the note which bore no address, and read,
pencilled in Henry&rsquo;s clear and very ornamental hand,
&ldquo;The bearer is trustworthy.&mdash;H. L. M.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>When she had looked so long at Henry&rsquo;s initials
that they had blurred and cleared again, not once but
many times, she walked mechanically down the path
until she came to the shed. Beside it was a barrel
full of rain-water. Into this she dipped Henry&rsquo;s note,
made sure that the words were totally illegible, poked
a hole in the border, and covered the sodden paper
with earth. Then at the potting-shed door she knelt
and became occupied with her shoe-lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry saw me after he saw you,&rdquo; said George
Patterson&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;He thought it might be a comfort
to you to know there is a friend on the spot; but
I&rsquo;m afraid I gave you a fright yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know why. I was
a perfect fool, and I ran right into Mr. Ember&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him what frightened you?&rdquo; said
Patterson quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t quite such a fool as that. Please,
who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name here is George Patterson. I&rsquo;m a friend
of Henry&rsquo;s. If you want me, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I want you,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;how am I to get at
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Patterson considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wide sill inside your window.&rdquo; (And
how on earth do you know that? thought Jane.)
&ldquo;If you put a big jar of, say, those yellow tulips there,
I&rsquo;ll know you want to speak to me, and I&rsquo;ll come here
to this potting-shed as soon as I can. You know
they keep us pretty busy with roll-calls and things of
that sort. I only got back yesterday by the skin of
my teeth&mdash;I had to bolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t pass me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t pass you.&rdquo; There was just a trace
of amusement in Mr. Patterson&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Jane pulled her shoe-lace undone, and began to tie
it all over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said very quick and low. &ldquo;Some one
is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just where the path ended, not half a dozen yards
away, the red-brick wall was pierced by a door. Two
round, Scotch rose-bushes, all tiny green leaf and
sharp brown prickle, grew like large pin-cushions on
either side of the interrupted border. Bright pink
nectarine buds shone against the brick like coral studs.
The ash-coloured door, rough and sun-blistered, was
opening slowly, and into the garden came Raymond
Heritage, pushing the door with one hand and holding
a basket of bulbs in the other. She was looking back
over her shoulder, at something or someone beside
her.</p>
<p>From inside the potting-shed came Patterson&rsquo;s voice&mdash;just
a breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane was up as she spoke and moving away. She
reached the door just as Raymond closed it and,
turning, saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Molloy&mdash;I was really looking for you.
Is Garstin anywhere about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him,&rdquo; murmured Jane, as if the
absent gardener might be blooming unnoticed in one
of the borders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in the potting-shed? I&rsquo;ll just look in
and see. I want to stand over him and see that he
puts these black irises where I want them to go.
They come from Palestine, and the last lot failed
entirely because he was so obstinate. I&rsquo;ll get a trowel
and mark the place I think.&rdquo; She moved forward as
she spoke, and Jane, horror-struck, stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> look. It&rsquo;s so dusty in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was back at the door of the shed, but Lady
Heritage was beside her. &ldquo;I want a trowel, too,&rdquo;
she said, and Jane felt herself gently pushed over the
threshold.</p>
<p>They were both just inside the door. It seemed
dark after the strong light outside. There was a row
of windows along one side, and a broad deal shelf
under them. There were piles and piles of pots and
boxes. There were hanks of bass and rows of tools,
There were watering-cans. There was a length of
rubber hose. But there was no George Patterson.</p>
<p>Jane put her hand behind her, gripped the jamb of
the door, and moved back a pace so that she could
lean against it. The pots, the tools, the bass and the
rubber hose danced before her bewildered eyes.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage put her basket of bulbs down on the
wide shelf and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garstin ought to be here. He&rsquo;s really very tiresome.
That&rsquo;s the worst of old servants. When a
gardener has been in a place for forty years as Garstin
has, he owns it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I find him?&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now. I really want to talk to you. I&rsquo;ve
just been speaking to Jeffrey Ember, and he tells me
you had a fright yesterday. What frightened you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;my own silliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane felt as if she must scream. George Patterson
had disappeared as if by a conjuring trick. Where
had he gone to? Where was he? It was just like
being in a dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Raymond Heritage seemed to tower before her in
her white dress. Her uncovered head almost touched
the low beam above the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey said you were blind with fright&mdash;that you
ran right into him. He said you were as white as a
sheet and shaking all over. I want to know what
frightened you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone&mdash;it fell into the sea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made it fall? A man? What man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane leaned against the door-post, her breath coming
and going, her eyes held by those imperious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it fell&mdash;I ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage, &ldquo;you walked
to the end of the headland, out of sight of the house.
Whilst you were there something gave you a serious
fright. Something&mdash;or somebody. This is all nonsense
about a stone. Whom did you see on the headland,
for you certainly saw somebody? No, don&rsquo;t look
away; I want you to look at me, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I was so frightened,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;It just came over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage looked at her very gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you saw any stranger on the headland, it is your
absolute duty to tell me. Where secrets of such value
are in question it is necessary to watch every avenue
and to neglect no suspicious circumstance. If you are
trying to screen any one, you are acting very foolishly&mdash;very
foolishly indeed. I warn you, and I ask you
again. What frightened you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Jane in a little whispering
voice. &ldquo;Why, why do you think there was any one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage briefly. &ldquo;I
know. Mr. Ember went up to the headland after he
left you, and there were footmarks in the gravel. Some
man had undoubtedly been there, and you must have
seen him. Mr. Ember made the entire round and saw
no one, but some one had been there. <i>Now</i> will you
tell me what you saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jane. Rather to her own astonishment
she began to cry. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why I was frightened
then! The stone fell so suddenly, and I didn&rsquo;t know
why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sobs choked her.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage stood looking at her for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you just an arrant little fool,&rdquo; she said in a low
voice, &ldquo;or....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; sobbed Jane. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve never been
called such a thing before! I know I&rsquo;m not clever, but
I don&rsquo;t think you ought to call me a f&mdash;f&mdash;fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage pressed her lips together, and walked
past Jane and out into the sunshine. She stood there
for a moment tapping with her foot. Then she called
rather impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy! Dry your eyes and come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane came, squeezing a damp handkerchief into a
ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring your flowers in; I see you&rsquo;ve left them over
there to die in the sun. I&rsquo;m driving into Withstead
this afternoon and you can come with me. I have to
see Mrs. Cottingham about some University extension
lectures, and she telephoned just now to say would I
bring you. She has a girl staying with her who thinks
she must have been at school with you or one of your
cousins. Her name is Daphne Todhunter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Jane stood perfectly still. Daphne Todhunter?
Arnold Todhunter&rsquo;s sister Daphne! Renata&rsquo;s friend!
But Daphne must know that Arnold was married?
The question was&mdash;whom <i>had</i> Arnold married. Had
his family welcomed (by letter) Jane Smith or Renata
Molloy to its bosom? If Renata Molloy, how in the
world was a second Renata to be explained to Miss
Daphne Todhunter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said
Lady Heritage.</p>
<p>Jane could not think quickly enough. Supposing
Lady Heritage went to Mrs. Cottingham&rsquo;s without her;
and supposing Daphne Todhunter were to say that her
brother Arnold had married a girl called Renata
Molloy?</p>
<p>It was too much to hope that Arnold had carried
discretion to the point of telling his own family that
he had married an unknown Jane Smith.</p>
<p>Jane suddenly threw up her chin and squared her
shoulders. The colour came back into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said, with a little caught breath.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was so silly, and for crying, and if I was
rude to you. It&rsquo;s most awfully kind of you to take
me into Withstead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there were any music to be faced, Jane was going
to face it. At least the tune should not be called
behind her back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span></h2>
<p>A feeling of exhilaration amounting to recklessness
possessed Jane as she put on the white
serge coat and skirt sacred to the Sabbath crocodile.
Attired in it Renata, side by side with Daphne Todhunter,
had, doubtless, walked many a time to church
and back. In front of her two white serge backs, behind
her more white serge, and more, and more, and
more. Jane&rsquo;s head reeled. She detested this garment,
but considered it appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p>They drove into Withstead across the marshes.
The sun blazed, and all the tiny marsh plants seemed
to be growing and stretching themselves.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cottingham lived in a villa on the outskirts of
the town, and was ashamed of it. She had married
kind little Dr. Cottingham, but imagined that she had
condescended in doing so. Her reasons for thinking
this were not apparent.</p>
<p>Jane followed Lady Heritage into the dark, rather
stuffy drawing-room, and beheld a middle-aged woman
with a rigidly controlled Victorian figure, a tightly
netted grey fringe, and a brown satin dress with a good
many little gold beads upon it. She had a breathless
sense of the extraordinary way in which the room was
overcrowded. Every inch of the walls was covered
with photographs, fans, engravings, and china plates.
Almost every inch of floor space was covered with small
ornamental tables crowded with knick-knacks. There
was a carved screen, and an ebonised overmantel with
looking-glass panels. There was a Japanese umbrella
in the fireplace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes looked hastily into every corner. There
were more things than she had ever seen in one room
before, but there was no Daphne Todhunter. Mrs.
Cottingham was shaking hands with her. She had a
fat hand and squeezed you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you Daphne&rsquo;s Miss Molloy?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She was <i>wildly</i> excited at the prospect of meeting
you, and I said at once, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just ring up Luttrell
Marches, and ask Lady Heritage to bring her here this
afternoon.&rsquo; I thought I <i>might</i> do that. You see, I
only happened to mention your name this morning,
and Daphne was so <i>excited</i>, and she goes away tomorrow,
so it was the only chance. So I thought I
would just ring up and ask Lady Heritage to bring
you. I said to Daphne at once, &lsquo;Lady Heritage is
so kind, I&rsquo;m sure she will bring Miss Molloy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane saw Lady Heritage&rsquo;s eyebrows rise very
slightly. She moved a step, and instantly Mrs. Cottingham
had turned from Jane:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Lady Heritage, you&rsquo;re standing! Now I
always say <i>this</i> is the most comfortable chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice went flowing on, but Jane suddenly
ceased to hear a word she said, for a door at the far
end of the room was flung open. On the threshold
appeared Miss Daphne Todhunter.</p>
<p>In common with most other Daphnes, Cynthias and
Ianthes, she was short and rather heavily built. Her
brown hair was untidy. She wore the twin coat and
skirt to that which was adorning Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>With an exclamation of rapture, she rushed across
the room, dislodging a book from one little table and
an ash-tray from another.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Her eyes are exactly like gooseberries which have
been boiled until they are brown,&rdquo; thought Jane, &ldquo;and
I <i>know</i> she&rsquo;s going to kiss me.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>She not only kissed Jane, she hugged her. Two
stout arms and a waft of white rose scent enveloped
Jane&rsquo;s shrinking form.</p>
<p>After a moment in which she wondered how long this
embrace would last, Jane managed to detach herself.
Mrs. Cottingham&rsquo;s voice fell gratefully upon her ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daphne, Daphne, my dear, come and speak to
Lady Heritage.&mdash;She&rsquo;s wildly excited, as I told you&mdash;the
natural enthusiasms of youth, dear Lady Heritage,
so beautiful, so quickly lost; I&rsquo;m sure you agree with
me.&mdash;Daphne, Daphne, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne came reluctantly and thrust a large hand
at Lady Heritage without looking at her. Raymond
looked at it for a moment, and, after a perceptible
pause, just touched the finger-tips. Mrs. Cottingham
never stopped talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it <i>is</i> your friend, and you&rsquo;re just too excited
for words. Take her away and have a good gossip.
Lady Heritage and I have a great deal to talk about.&mdash;You
were saying....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was saying,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage wearily, &ldquo;that
you must write at once if you want Masterson to
lecture for you next winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne dragged Jane to the far end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Renata, how perfectly delicious! But how did
you come here? And what are you doing, and where&rsquo;s
Arnold, and why aren&rsquo;t you with him?&rdquo; She made a
pounce at Jane&rsquo;s left hand, and felt the third finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where&rsquo;s your ring?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>They reached a sofa and sank upon it. Immediately
in front of them was an octagonal table of
light-coloured wood profusely carved. Upon it,
amongst lesser portraits, stood a tall photograph of
Mrs. Cottingham in a train, and feathers, and a tiara.
The sofa was low, and Jane felt that fate had been
kinder than she deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Renata, aren&rsquo;t you married?&rdquo; breathed
Daphne.</p>
<p>She breathed very hard, and Jane was reminded of
Arnold on the fire-escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Renata, tell me! When she ... Mrs.
Cottingham said, &lsquo;Miss Renata Molloy,&rsquo; I nearly died.
I said, &lsquo;Miss Molloy?&rsquo; And she said, &lsquo;Yes, Miss
Renata Molloy,&rsquo; and oh, I very nearly let the cat out
of the bag.&rdquo; She grasped Jane&rsquo;s hand and pressed it
violently. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t. Arnold told me not to,
and I didn&rsquo;t, but, of course, I&rsquo;m simply <i>dying</i> to know
all about everything. Now, darling, tell me ...
tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never in her life had Jane felt so much aloof from
any human creature. There was something so inexpressibly
comic in the idea of pouring out her heart
to Daphne Todhunter that she did not even feel
nervous, only aloof&mdash;aloof, and cool. She looked
earnestly at Daphne, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Arnold tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was the greatest shock,&rdquo; said Daphne, &ldquo;and
such a surprise. One minute there he was, moving
about at home, and not knowing when he would get
a job, and perfectly distracted with hopelessness about
you; and the next he rushed down to say good-bye
because he was going to Bolivia, and his heart was
broken because you wouldn&rsquo;t go too....&rdquo; She
stopped for breath, and squeezed Jane&rsquo;s hand even
harder than before. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;you can imagine what a shock it was to get the
letter-card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;it must have been. What did
it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne opened her eyes and her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he show it to you? How perfectly extraordinary
of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;What did he
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it by heart,&rdquo; said Daphne ardently. &ldquo;I
could repeat every word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for goodness&rsquo; sake do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata! How odd you are, not a bit like yourself!&rdquo;
Fear stabbed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what he said&mdash;tell me what he said,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>
<p>With an effort she pressed the hand that was
squeezing hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Arnold, in the letter-card? But I think it
was just too weird of him not to have shown it to you&mdash;too
extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane felt that she was becoming dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it all by heart. I could say it in my sleep.
He said, &lsquo;Just off; we sail together. We were married
this morning, and I&rsquo;m the happiest man in the world.
Don&rsquo;t tell any one at present. If you love me, not a
word to a soul. Will write from Bolivia.&mdash;<span class="sc">Arnold.</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
P. S.&mdash;On no account tell Aunt Ethel.&rsquo; So you see why
I nearly died when she said Miss Renata Molloy, for
of course I thought you were in Bolivia with Arnold,
and oh, Renata, where is he and what has happened?
Tell me everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung her arms about Jane&rsquo;s neck as she spoke
and gave her a long, clinging kiss. Jane endured it
under pressure of that, &ldquo;You are not a bit like yourself.&rdquo;
When she had borne it for as long as she could,
she drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me&mdash;tell me the worst&mdash;tell me everything.
Where is Arnold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arnold is in Bolivia,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why aren&rsquo;t you with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane produced a pocket-handkerchief. It was a
very little one, but it sufficed. In her own mind Jane
described it as local colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have parted,&rdquo; she said, and dabbed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata! But you&rsquo;re married to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane, quite truthfully.</p>
<p>An inward thankfulness that she was not married to
Arnold supported her.</p>
<p>Daphne stared at her with bulging eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not! But he said, &lsquo;We were married this
morning.&rsquo; I read it with my own eyes, and I could
repeat it in my sleep. I know it by heart....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane checked her with a look that held so much
mysterious meaning that the flood of words was
actually stemmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t marry <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Jane, in a tense whisper.
She looked straight into the boiled gooseberry eyes,
and then covered her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t marry you?&rdquo; repeated Daphne, gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane, from behind the handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Renata!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Todhunter cast herself upon Jane&rsquo;s neck and
burst into tears. The impact was considerable and
her weight no light one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daphne, please&mdash;please&mdash;Lady Heritage is looking
at us. Do sit up. I can&rsquo;t tell you anything if you cry.
There&rsquo;s really nothing to cry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne sat up again. She also produced a handkerchief,
a very large one with &ldquo;Daphne&rdquo; embroidered
across the corner in coral pink. A terrific blast of
white rose emerged with the handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was so much in love with you,&rdquo; she wailed.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it. How <i>could</i> he marry any one
else and break your heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is not broken,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was your fault, and you&rsquo;ve broken his,
and he&rsquo;s got married just to show he doesn&rsquo;t care,
like people do in books. I don&rsquo;t believe you love him
a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked modestly at the carpet, which was of a
lively shade of crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, in a very small
voice.</p>
<p>An unbecoming flush mounted to Daphne&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ve got the face,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Much to Jane&rsquo;s relief, she withdrew from her to the
farthest corner of the sofa, and then glared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Arnold! Aunt Ethel always did say you
were sly. She always said she wouldn&rsquo;t trust you a
yard.&rdquo; She paused, sniffed, and then added, in what
was meant for a tone of great dignity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please, whom <i>has</i> Arnold married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her&mdash;her name is Jane, I believe,&rdquo; said Jane, with
a tremor.</p>
<p>At this moment she became aware that Lady Heritage
had risen to her feet. Mrs. Cottingham&rsquo;s voice
clamoured for attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lady Heritage, not without your tea! It
won&rsquo;t be a moment. Indeed, I couldn&rsquo;t dream of
letting you go like this. Just a cup of tea, you know,
so refreshing. Indeed, it would distress me to think of
your facing that long drive without your tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond stood perfectly still, her face weary and
unresponsive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid my time is not my own,&rdquo; she said, and
crossed the room to where the two girls were sitting.
They both rose, Daphne with a jerk that dislodged a
photograph frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I must interrupt your talk,&rdquo; said Lady
Heritage. &ldquo;Were you living school triumphs over
again? I suppose you swept off all the prizes between
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there was irony in the indifferent voice, Miss Todhunter
was unaware of it. She laughed rather loudly,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata never won a prize in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Raymond, with a lift of the brows. &ldquo;I
am surprised. I pictured her always at the head of
her class, and winning everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne laughed again. She was still angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s been putting on side,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why, Miss Basing would have fainted with surprise
if she had found Renata anywhere near the top of
anything. Or me either,&rdquo; she added, with reluctant
honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;ask Mrs. Cottingham
if she will let Lewis know that we are ready;&rdquo;
and as Jane moved away, she continued, &ldquo;I should
have thought her languages now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne&rsquo;s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she <i>must</i> have been
piling it on. Why, her languages were rotten, absolutely
rotten. Why, Mademoiselle said that I was
enough to break her heart, but when it came to Renata
it was just, &lsquo;Mon dieu!&rsquo; the whole time; and then
there were rows because Miss Basing thought it was
profane. Only, somehow it seems different in French&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage looked at Daphne as though she had
some difficulty in thinking about her at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said gravely, and then Mrs. Cottingham
bore down upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea should have been ready if I had known,&rdquo; she
said. Her colour had risen, and her voice shook a
little. &ldquo;If I could persuade you ... I&rsquo;m sure it
won&rsquo;t be more than a moment. But, of course, if you
must ... but if I had only known. You see, I
thought to myself we would have our talk first, and
then enjoy our tea comfortably, and indeed it is <i>just</i>
coming in&mdash;but, of course, if you are <i>obliged</i> to go....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much; I am obliged to go. Good-bye,
Mrs. Cottingham. You&rsquo;ll write to Masterson
and let me know what the answer is? I think I hear
the car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Miss Todhunter, who had embraced her friend so
warmly half an hour before, parted from her with a
tepid handshake; but if neither Daphne nor Mrs.
Cottingham considered the visit a success, Lady Heritage
seemed to derive some satisfaction from it, and
Jane told herself that not only had a danger been
averted, but a distinct advantage had been gained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span></h2>
<p>Jane ran straight up to her room when they got
back, but she was no sooner there than it came
into her mind to wonder whether she had put away
the files which she had been working on just before she
went into the garden. Think as she would, she could
not be sure.</p>
<p>She ran down again and went quickly along the
corridor to the library. The door was unlatched.
She touched the handle, pushed it a little, and stood
hesitating. Lady Heritage was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a satisfaction to know just where one is.
Sometimes I&rsquo;ve been convinced she was a fool, and
then again ... well, I&rsquo;ve wondered. I wondered this
afternoon in the garden. That man on the headland
gives one to think furiously. Who on earth could it
have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... don&rsquo;t ... know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe she saw him. I don&rsquo;t believe
she saw anything or knew why she was frightened.
She just got a start ... a shock&mdash;began to run without
knowing why, and ran herself into a blind panic.
She looked quite idiotic when I was questioning her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought Jane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible to listen at
doors, but what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What she did was to go on listening. She heard
Lady Heritage&rsquo;s rare laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then this afternoon&mdash;my dear Jeffrey, it would
have convinced you or any one. The friend&mdash;this
Daphne Todhunter&mdash;well, only a fool could have made
a bosom friend of her, and, as I told you, even she
had the lowest opinion of her adored Renata&rsquo;s
brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Ember again. &ldquo;You say she&rsquo;s
a fool, I say she&rsquo;s a fool, her friend says she&rsquo;s a fool,
but something, some instinct in me protests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Womanly intuition,&rdquo; said Lady Heritage, with a
mocking note.</p>
<p>There was silence; then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These girls&mdash;were they alone together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They conducted what appeared to be a
curiously emotional conversation at the other end of
Mrs. Cottingham&rsquo;s dreadful drawing-room, which
always reminds me of a parish jumble sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember&rsquo;s voice sounded suddenly much nearer, as if
he had crossed the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emotional? What do you mean?&rdquo; he said quickly.
Lady Heritage laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Does that sort of thing mean
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of thing? Please, it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hand-holding, and a tearful embrace or two.
The usual accompaniments of schoolgirl <i>schw&auml;rmerei</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane could hear that Ember was moving restlessly.
Her own heart was beating. She knew very well that
in Ember&rsquo;s mind there was just one thought&mdash;&ldquo;Suppose
she has told Daphne Todhunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of them cried?&rdquo; said Ember sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they both did&mdash;Miss Todhunter most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you couldn&rsquo;t hear what they were saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must know. Will you send for her and find out?
It&rsquo;s of the first importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have told this girl what we&rsquo;ve been trying
to get out of her. I must know. Look here, I&rsquo;ll take
a book and sit down over there. She won&rsquo;t notice
me. Send for her and begin about other things, then
ask her why her friend was so distressed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane heard Ember move again and knew that this
time it was towards the bell. She turned and ran
back along the way by which she had come. Five
minutes later she was entering the library to find Lady
Heritage at her table and Ember at the far end of
the room buried in a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the unanswered-letter file.&rdquo; Lady Heritage&rsquo;s
voice was very businesslike.</p>
<p>Jane brought it over and waited whilst Raymond
turned over the letters, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Lady Manning&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answered it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did. Miss Molloy&mdash;why did your friend cry
this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daphne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Daphne. Why did she cry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she does, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I suppose not entirely without some cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was angry with me,&rdquo; said Jane very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? I noticed that she did not kiss you when
you went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s angry. You see&rdquo;&mdash;Jane hung her
head&mdash;&ldquo;you see, she thinks&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid she thinks
that I didn&rsquo;t treat her brother very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her brother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She wanted me to be engaged to him, but
he&rsquo;s married some one else, so I think it&rsquo;s rather silly
of her to be cross with me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the tail of her eye Jane saw Mr. Ember nod
his head just perceptibly. Lady Heritage must have
seen it too, for she pushed the letter file over to Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put this away. No, I don&rsquo;t want anything more
at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tea came in as she spoke.</p>
<p>Afterwards in her own room Jane sat down on the
broad window ledge with her hands in her lap, looking
out over the sea. The lovely day was drawing slowly
to a lovelier close, the sun-drenched air absolutely
still, absolutely clear. The tide was low, the sea one
sheet of unbroken blue, except where the black rocks,
more visible than Jane had ever seen them, pierced
the surface.</p>
<p>Jane did not quite know what had happened to her.
Her moment of exhilaration was gone. She was not
afraid, but she felt a sense of horror which she had not
known before. She had thought of this adventure
as <i>her</i> adventure, her own risk. Somehow she had
never really related it to other people. For the first
time, she began to see Formula &ldquo;A,&rdquo; not as something
which threatened her, but as something that menaced
the world. It was ridiculous that it was Mrs. Cottingham
and Daphne Todhunter who had caused this
change.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>It is one thing to think vaguely of civilisation being
swept away, and <i>quite</i> another to visualise some concrete,
humdrum Tom, Dick, or Harry being swept
horribly out of existence. Jane&rsquo;s imagination suddenly
showed her Formula &ldquo;A&rdquo;&mdash;The Process, whatever
they chose to call the horrible thing&mdash;in operation;
showed it annihilating fussy Mrs. Cottingham, with her
overcrowded drawing-room and her overcrowded talk;
showed it doing something horrible to fat, common
Daphne Todhunter. The romance of adventure fell
away, the glamour that sometimes surrounds catastrophe
shrivelled and was gone. It was horrible, only
horrible.</p>
<p>Jane kept seeing Mrs. Cottingham&rsquo;s ugly room, and
Raymond Heritage standing there, as she had seen her
that afternoon, like a statue that had nothing to do
with its surroundings. All at once she knew what
it was that Lady Heritage reminded her of&mdash;not
Mercury at all, but Medusa with the lovely, tortured
face, stone and yet suffering.</p>
<p>As she looked out over that calm sea she had before
her all the time the vision of Medusa, and of hundreds
and hundreds of quite ordinary, vulgar, commonplace
Mrs. Cottinghams and Daphne Todhunters being
turned to stone. A tremor began to shake her. It
kept coming again and again. Then, all at once, the
tears were running down her face. It was then it
came to her that she could not bear to think of Daphne
as she had seen her at the last, with that hurt, angry,
puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fat lump, but Arnold is her brother, and
Renata is her friend, and she thinks they&rsquo;ve failed
each other and been horrid to her. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Jane hated herself fiercely because
Daphne&rsquo;s tears had amused her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a brick instead of a heart, and, if you
get eliminated, it&rsquo;ll serve you right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>She dabbed her eyes very hard, straightened her
hair, and ran downstairs to the library again.</p>
<p>Ember was the sole occupant, and Jane addressed
him with diffidence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ember, do you think I might ... do you
think Lady Heritage would mind ... I mean, may I
use the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said Ember, looking at her over the
edge of his paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps I might,&rdquo; said Jane ... &ldquo;I
mean, I wanted to say something to my friend, the
one who is staying with Mrs. Cottingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;yes, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, certainly. Do you want me to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane presented a picture of modest confusion. It
was concern for Daphne Todhunter that had brought
her downstairs, concern and the prickings of remorse,
but at the sight of Ember, she experienced what she
would have described as a brain-wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry
to disturb you, but I did rather want to talk privately
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by all means.&rdquo; Ember&rsquo;s tone was most
amiable, his departure most courteously prompt.</p>
<p>Jane would have been prepared to bet the eighteen-pence
which constituted her sole worldly fortune to a
brass farthing that upon the other side of the door his
attentive ear would miss no word of her conversation.</p>
<p>She gave Mrs. Cottingham&rsquo;s number, and waited
in some anxiety.</p>
<p>The voice that said &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; was unmistakably
Miss Todhunter&rsquo;s, and Jane began at once:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daphne, is that you? I want to speak to
you so badly. Are you alone? Good! I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the other end of the line Daphne was saying
grumpily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. There are three
people in the room. I keep telling you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Jane, with a little more emphasis. &ldquo;I
want to speak to you most particularly. I&rsquo;ve been
awfully unhappy since this afternoon; I really have.
And I wanted to say&mdash;&mdash; I mean to ask you not to be
upset about Arnold. It&rsquo;s all for the best, really.
Please, please, don&rsquo;t think badly of him. It&rsquo;s not his
fault, and I know you&rsquo;ll like his wife very much indeed.
He&rsquo;ll tell you all about it some day, and you&rsquo;ll think
it ever so romantic. So you won&rsquo;t be unhappy about
it, will you? I hate people to be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for Miss Todhunter&rsquo;s reply, Jane
hung up the receiver. After a decent interval she
opened the door. Mr. Ember was at the far end of the
passage, waiting patiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span></h2>
<p>Jane waked that night, and did not know why she
waked. After a moment it came to her that
she had been dreaming. In her dream something
unpleasant had happened, and she did not know what
it was. She sat up in the darkness with her hands
pressed over her eyes, trying to remember.</p>
<p>The vague feeling of having passed through some
horrifying experience oppressed her far more than
definite recollection could have done.</p>
<p>She got up, switched on the light, and began to pace
up and down, but she could not shake off that feeling
of having left something, she did not know what,
just behind her, just out of sight. She looked round
for the book she had been reading, but she remembered
now that she had left it downstairs. She looked at
her watch. It was three o&rsquo;clock. The house would
be absolutely still and empty. It would not take her
two minutes to fetch the book from the drawing-room.
She slipped on Renata&rsquo;s dressing-gown, put out her
light, and opened the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>With a little shock of surprise she saw that the
corridor was dark. Some one must have put out the
light which always burned at the far end. Instead of
the usual faintly rosy glow, there was darkness thinning
to dusk, and just at the stairhead a vivid splash of
moonlight. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Jane slipped
out of her room, leaving the door ajar. Somehow she
had not reckoned upon having to cross that brightly
lighted space. She came slowly to the head of the
stairs and looked down into the hall. It was like
looking into the blackness and silence of a vast well.
She could see nothing&mdash;nothing at all. The moon was
shining in through the rose window above the great
door. There was a shield in the window, a shield with
the Luttrell arms, and the light came through the glass
in a great beam shot with colour, and struck the
portrait of Lady Heritage and the vine leaves and
grapes on the newel just below. The window and the
portrait were on the same level, and the ray seemed to
make a brilliant cleavage between the silvery dusk
above and the dense gloom below.</p>
<p>Jane descended the stairs, walking carefully so as to
make no noise. At the foot she turned sharply to the
left and passed the study door, the fireplace, and the
steel gate which shut off the north wing. The door of
the Yellow Drawing-Room was straight in front of her.
She opened it softly and went in.</p>
<p>The book would be on the little table to the right
of the fireplace, because she remembered putting it
there when Lady Heritage made an unexpectedly
early move. She stood for a moment visualising the
arrangement of the chairs, and then walked straight
to the right place. The book was where she had left
it, put down open, a bad habit for which Jimmy had
often rebuked her. She was back at the door with it,
and just about to pass the threshold when she heard
a sound. Instantly she stood still, listening. The
sound came from the other end of the hall, where
the shadows lay deepest round the massive oak
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there can&rsquo;t be any one at the door at this
hour,&rdquo; said Jane&mdash;&ldquo;there can&rsquo;t, there can&rsquo;t possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound came again, something between a rustle
and a creak, but so faint that no hearing less acute
than Jane&rsquo;s would have caught it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the left of the door, underneath Willoughby
Luttrell&rsquo;s picture....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane suddenly pressed her hand to her lips and made
an involuntary movement backwards, for there was an
unmistakable click, and then, slow and faint, a footfall.
Jane stood rigid, staring into the darkness of the
corner. She thought she heard a sigh, and then the
footsteps crossed the hall, coming nearer. At the
stair foot they paused, and then began to ascend.</p>
<p>Jane gazed into the deeply shadowed space where
the footfall sounded, but nothing&mdash;not the slightest
glimpse of anything moving&mdash;came to her straining
sight.</p>
<p>She looked up and saw the level ray of moonlight
overhead. Whoever climbed the stair must pass up
into the light and be visible, but from where she stood
she could only see the side of the stair like a black wall.
But she must see&mdash;she must. If some one had come
out of the darkness where there was no door she must
know who it was. Her bare feet made no sound as she
moved from the sheltering doorway. Step by step
she kept pace with those slow mounting footsteps.
She passed the steel gate, and, feeling her way along
the wall, came to a standstill by the cold black hearth.
Then, with her whole body tense, she turned and
looked up. There was a darker shadow among the
shadows, a shadow that moved upwards, towards the
beam of moonlight. Jane watched, breathless, and
from where The Portrait hung, the sombre eyes of
Raymond Heritage seemed to watch too. Out of
blackness into dusk a something emerged; one step
more and the moonlight fell on a dark hood. Up into
the light came a cloaked figure, draped from head to
foot, shapeless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>On the top step it turned. Jane caught her breath.
It was Lady Heritage. She stood there for a long
minute, her left hand just resting on the newel post
with its twining tendrils and massive overhanging
grapes. The light shone full upon her, and her face
was sharpened, blanched, and sorrowful. Her eyes
seemed to look into unfathomable depths of gloom.
The amber, the rose, and the violet of the stained glass
fell in a hazy iridescence upon the black of her cloak.</p>
<p>In front the cloak fell away and showed the straight
white linen of an overall, and cloak and overall were
deeply stained with dull wet smears. A piece of the
stuff hung jagged from a tear.</p>
<p>Jane looked, and could not take her eyes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s so unhappy,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>
<p>With a quick movement Raymond Heritage pushed
the hood back from her hair. Then she turned, faced
her own portrait for a moment, and passed slowly
out of sight. Jane heard a door close very softly.</p>
<p>She stood quite still and waited, gathering her
courage. She would have to mount the stair and pass
through that light before she could reach the safely
shadowed corridor. Just for a moment it seemed as
if she could not do it. Her feet seemed to cleave to
the ground. Five minutes passed, and another
five.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Jane felt herself becoming rigid, and with a tremendous
effort, she took one step forward, but only one,
for as her foot touched a new cold patch of floor,
some one moved overhead.</p>
<p>For an instant a little pencil of electric light jabbed
into the darkness and went out again. The next
moment Mr. Ember stepped into the moonlight. He
too wore a linen overall, and in his left hand he carried
the mask-like head-dress which was in use in the laboratories.
His right hand held a torch.</p>
<p>He came down the stairs, walking with astonishing
lightness. Half-way down the torch came into play
again. He sent the little ray in a sort of dazzle-dance
about the hall. With every leaping flash Jane&rsquo;s heart
gave a jump, and she only stopped her teeth from
chattering by biting hard upon the cuff of Renata&rsquo;s
dressing-gown. She had covered her face instinctively,
and peered, terror-stricken, between her fingers.</p>
<p>The light skimmed right across her once, and but for
the crimson flannel, she would certainly have screamed
aloud. If Mr. Ember had been looking, he could have
seen a semicircle of white forehead, two clutching
hands, and a quivering chin. But his eyes were elsewhere,
and the dancing flash passed on.</p>
<p>Ember crossed the hall to the far corner out of which
Lady Heritage had come. Suddenly the light went
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Jane heard again the very, very small creaking noise
which she had heard before. It was followed by a
faint click, and then unmitigated silence. The seconds
added themselves together and became minutes, and
there was no further sound. The minutes passed, and
the beam of moonlight slipped slowly downwards.
Now The Portrait was in darkness, now the newels
were just two black shadows. It was a long, long time
before Jane moved. She climbed the staircase with
terror in her heart. At the edge of the moonlight she
waited so long that it moved to meet her. When the
edge of it touched her bare, hesitating foot she gave a
violent start, and ran the rest of the way.</p>
<p>The dark corridor felt like a haven of refuge.</p>
<p>She came panting to her own door, and suddenly
there was no haven of refuge anywhere. The door
was shut. She had left it ajar. It was shut.</p>
<p>Jane stood with her outstretched hand flat on the
panel of the door. She kept saying over and over to
herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left it open, but it&rsquo;s shut. I left it open, but
it&rsquo;s shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once she pushed the door as if it could not really
be shut at all, but it did not yield; the latch had caught.
It was shut. At last she turned the handle slowly
and went in. A gust of wind met her full. Perhaps
it was the wind that had shut the door. She left it
ajar, moved to the middle of the room, and waited.
For a moment there was a lull. Somewhere in the
house a clock struck four. The sound came just
over the edge of hearing, with its four tiny distant
strokes. Then the wind rushed in again through the
open window, and the door fell to with a click.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span></h2>
<p>By next morning the wind had brought rain
with it. A south-west gale drove against the
dripping window-panes, and covered the sea with
crests of foam.</p>
<p>Jane, rather pale, wrote a neat letter to the Misses
Kent, Hermione Street, South Kensington, mentioning
that she would be much obliged if they would send
her patterns of jumper wool by return. She hesitated,
and then underlined the last two words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always think big shops do you better,&rdquo; was Lady
Heritage&rsquo;s comment, and Mr. Ember added, &ldquo;Do
you knit, Miss Renata? I thought you were the only
girl in England who didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;to which Jane replied,
&ldquo;I want to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after the letter had been posted that she
found Henry&rsquo;s second message, &ldquo;Hope to see you
to-day, Friday.&rdquo; She could have cried for pure
joy.</p>
<p>At intervals during the day, the thought occurred
to her that Henry was a solid comfort. She wasn&rsquo;t
in love with him, of course, but undoubtedly he was a
comfort. She had plenty of time to think, for she
spent the entire day by herself. Sir William had gone
to town for three or four days. Lady Heritage disappeared
into the north wing at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and
very shortly after, Mr. Ember followed her. Neither
of them appeared again until dinner-time. Jane went
to sleep over a book and awoke refreshed, and with a
strong desire for exploration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>If only last night&rsquo;s mysterious happenings had taken
place anywhere but in the hall. The dark corner
from which Raymond had emerged and into which
Mr. Ember had vanished drew her like a magnet,
but not until every one was in bed and asleep would
she dare to search for the hidden door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were just sitting here and reading,&rdquo; she
thought to herself, &ldquo;probably no one would come
into the hall for hours; but if I were to look for a
secret passage, all the servants would begin to drift
in and out, and the entire neighbourhood would come
and call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the lights had been turned on, she wandered
round, looking at the Luttrell portraits. This, she
thought, was safe enough, and if not the rose, it was
at least near it. Willoughby Luttrell&rsquo;s picture hung
perhaps five feet from the ground and about half-way
between the hall door and the corner. Jane had
always noticed it particularly because Henry undoubtedly
resembled this eighteenth century uncle.</p>
<p>Mr. Willoughby Luttrell had been painted in a
Court suit of silver-grey satin. He wore Mechlin
ruffles and diamond shoe-buckles. He had the air
of being convinced that the Court of St. James could
boast no brighter ornament, but his face was the face
of Henry March, and Henry&rsquo;s grey eyes looked down
at Jane from beneath a Ramillies wig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>After an interval Jane stopped looking at Mr.
Luttrell&rsquo;s eyes, and reflected that the click which she
had heard the night before came from a point nearer
the corner. She did not dare go near enough to feel
the wall, and no amount of staring at the panelling
disclosed any clue to the secret.</p>
<p>Jane went back to her book.</p>
<p>By sunset the rain had ceased to fall, or, rather to
be driven against the land. The wind, lightened of its
burden of moisture, kept coming inland in great gusts,
fresh and soft with the freshness and softness of the
spring. The entire sky was thickly covered with
clouds which moved continually across its face, swept
on by the currents of the upper air, but these clouds
were very high up. Any one coming out of an enclosed
place into the windy night would have received
an impression of extraordinary freedom, movement,
and space.</p>
<p>Henry March received such an impression as he
turned a pivoting stone block and came out of the
small sheltering cave behind the seat on the headland
above Luttrell Marches. At the first buffet of the
gale he took off his cap, and stuffed it down into the
pocket of the light ulster which he wore, and stood
bareheaded, looking out to sea. His eyes showed him
blackness and confused motion, and his ears were
filled with the strange singing sound of the wind and
the endless crash and recoil of the waves against a
shingly beach.</p>
<p>He stood quite still for a time and then turned his
wrist and glanced at the luminous dial of the watch
upon it, after which he passed again behind the stone
seat and was about to re-enter the blacker shadows
when a tall figure emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve only just come. How are you, Tony?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be down here
again so soon. It was touch and go whether I could
get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Look here, Tony,
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go inside. It&rsquo;s a topping night, and that
passage I&rsquo;ve just come along smells like a triple extract
of vaults&mdash;perfectly beastly. I don&rsquo;t suppose our
friend Ember is addicted to being out late. He doesn&rsquo;t
strike me as that sort of bird somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Anthony Luttrell. He sat down
on the stone seat as he spoke, and Henry followed his
example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy sent you down, did he? What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was silent. It seemed like quite a long time
before he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, who knows about the passages beside you
and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; said Anthony shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle James told me when he thought the Boche
had done you in. He said then that no one knew
except he and I. He drew out a plan of all the
passages and made me learn it by heart. When I
could draw it with my eyes shut, we burnt every
scrap of paper I had touched. I&rsquo;ve been into the
passages exactly three times&mdash;once that same week
to test my knowledge, again the other day, and
to-night. I&rsquo;ll swear no one saw me go in or come out,
and I&rsquo;ll swear I&rsquo;ve never breathed a word to a
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you rehearsing your autobiography?&rdquo; inquired
Anthony Luttrell, with more than a hint of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. I want to know who else knows
about the passages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, it is no good. I had my suspicions the other
night, but to-night I&rsquo;ve got proof. The passages have
been made use of. Unfortunately there&rsquo;s no doubt
about it at all. I want to know whether you have
any idea&mdash;hang it all, Tony, you must see what I&rsquo;m
driving at! Wait a minute; don&rsquo;t go through the
roof until you&rsquo;ve heard what I&rsquo;ve got to say. You
see, I know that Uncle James gave you the plan when
you were only sixteen, because he thought he was
dying then, and I&rsquo;ve come down here to ask you
whether any one might have seen you coming and
going as a boy, or whether ... Tony, <i>did</i> you ever
tell any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said that it was Piggy&rsquo;s orders
that brought you down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to gather then that Piggy has suggested
these damned impertinent questions?&rdquo; Mr. Luttrell&rsquo;s
tone was easy to a degree.</p>
<p>Henry, on the verge of losing his temper, rose
abruptly to his feet, walked half a dozen paces with
his hands shoved well down in his pockets, and then
walked back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, what on earth&rsquo;s the good of quarrelling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony Luttrell was leaning back, his head against
the back of the stone seat, his long legs stretched out in
front of him. He appeared to be watching the race
of clouds between the horizon and the zenith. He
said something, and the wind took his words away.</p>
<p>Henry sat down again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Tony,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve not answered
my question. Did you ever tell any one?
Damn it all, Tony, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask if I didn&rsquo;t have to!...
Did you ever tell Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great gust swept the headland, another and more
violent one followed it, battered against the cliff, and
then dropped suddenly into what, after the tumult,
seemed like a silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy speaking, or you?&rdquo; said Anthony Luttrell
quite lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound heated, Henry. Now I should have
thought that that would have been my r&ocirc;le. Instead,
I merely repeat to you, and you in your turn, of course,
repeat to Piggy that I have told no one about the
passages, and, after you have admired my moderation,
perhaps we might change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Tony,
do you mind sitting up and looking at this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he placed &ldquo;this&rdquo; on the seat between
them and turned a light upon it, holding the torch
close down on to the seat so that the beam did not
travel beyond its edge. Mr. Luttrell turned lazily
and saw a small handkerchief of very fine linen with
an embroidered &ldquo;R&rdquo; in the corner. He continued to
look at it, and Henry continued to hold the torch so
that the light fell upon the initial. Then quite suddenly
Anthony Luttrell reached sideways and switched off
the light. His hand dropped to the handkerchief and
covered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;but I thought
you ought to know that I found it in the passage behind
us, just where one stoops to shift the stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one I found and dropped,&rdquo; said Anthony,
putting it into his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Henry said nothing at all.</p>
<p>A somewhat prolonged silence was broken by
Luttrell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m chucking my job here,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written to Sir Julian. Here&rsquo;s the letter for you
to give him.&rdquo; He pushed it along the seat as he
spoke, and Henry picked it up reluctantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
asked to be replaced with as little delay as possible.
You might urge that point on him, if you don&rsquo;t mind.
I want it made perfectly clear that under no circumstances
will I stay on more than three days. I will,
in fact, see the whole department damned first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke without the slightest heat, in the rather
cold, drawling manner which Henry had known as a
danger-signal from the days when he was a small boy,
and Anthony a big one and his idol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you giving any reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no reason to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy,&rdquo; said Henry thoughtfully, &ldquo;will want
one. It&rsquo;s all very well for you, Tony, to write him a
letter and say you&rsquo;re going to chuck your job without
giving a reason. I&rsquo;ve got to stand up at the other
side of his table and stick out a cross-examination
on the probable nature of the reasons which you
haven&rsquo;t given. You&rsquo;re putting me in an impossible
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that damned conscience of yours, I suppose!
I cannot tell a lie, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to Piggy about this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Anthony, getting to his feet,
&ldquo;tell him the truth. Why should I care? I suppose,
in common with everybody else, he is perfectly well
aware that I once made a fool of myself about Lady
Heritage. Well, I thought I could stick being down
here and seeing her, but I can&rsquo;t. It just comes to
that. I can&rsquo;t stick it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t. She sees me in an overall and a
mask. She has been pleased to commend my skill.
This afternoon she leaned over my shoulder to watch
what I was doing. Well, I came away and wrote to
Piggy. I can&rsquo;t stand it, and you can tell him so with
the utmost circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was leaning forward, chin in hand. He looked
past Anthony at the black moving water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you see Raymond?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No,
Tony, you&rsquo;ve just got to listen to me. What you&rsquo;ve
been saying is true as far as it goes, but it doesn&rsquo;t
go very far. You wouldn&rsquo;t chuck your job just for
that. You know, and I know that you&rsquo;re chucking
it because you are afraid that Raymond is involved.
If you know it, and I know it, don&rsquo;t you think Piggy
will know it too? That&rsquo;s why I say, see Raymond.
If she&rsquo;s let herself get mixed up with this show, it&rsquo;s
because she&rsquo;s had a rotten time and wants to hit back.
She said as much to me&mdash;oh, not &agrave; propos of this, of
course; we were just talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard her,&rdquo; said Anthony Luttrell. He paused,
and added with a distinct sneer, &ldquo;You displayed an
admirable discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Tony. Now what&rsquo;s the good of you
clearing out? If you do, Piggy will send some one
else down here, and if Raymond has got mixed up
with any of Ember&rsquo;s devilry, she&rsquo;ll get caught out.
For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, Tony, see her, let her know you&rsquo;re
alive! I believe she&rsquo;d chuck the whole thing and go
to the ends of the earth with you. Nobody would
press the matter. We should catch Ember out, and
you and Raymond could go abroad for a bit. I don&rsquo;t
see any other way out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to me to be assuming a good deal,
Henry,&rdquo; said Anthony Luttrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not assuming anything&rdquo;&mdash;Henry&rsquo;s tone was
very blunt. &ldquo;I know three things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&rdquo;&mdash;Henry ticked his facts off on the fingers of
his left hand: &ldquo;the passages are being used. Two:
they&rsquo;ve been wired for electric light. Three: Raymond
has been through them, and quite lately. Those
three facts, taken in conjunction with a deposition
stating that something of a highly dangerous and
anti-social nature is being manufactured on these
premises, and under cover of the Government experiments&mdash;well,
Tony, I don&rsquo;t suppose you want me to
dot the &lsquo;i&rsquo;s&rsquo; and cross the &lsquo;t&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never occurred to you that my father might
have had the place wired, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Tony.
You can&rsquo;t bluff me, and I hate your trying to.
There&rsquo;s only one way out of this. You&rsquo;ve got to see
Raymond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony made an impatient movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You assume too much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll put
that on one side. From the cold, official standpoint,
where does my interview with Lady Heritage come
in? Wouldn&rsquo;t it rather complicate matters? You
appear to assume that there is a conspiracy, and then
to suggest that I should warn one of the conspirators.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not. I ask you to let Raymond know
that you are alive, nothing more. In my view nothing
more is necessary. She&rsquo;ll naturally think you are here
to see her, and you can let her think so. As to the
cold, official standpoint, the last thing that the department
would want is a scandal about a woman in
Raymond&rsquo;s position. Piggy would say what I say&mdash;for
the Lord&rsquo;s sake get her out of it and let us have a
free hand. She&rsquo;s an appalling complication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women always are,&rdquo; said Anthony Luttrell in
his bitter drawl.</p>
<p>He moved a pace or two away, and then turned back
again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bad sort in spite of the conscience,
Henry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From your standpoint,
what you&rsquo;ve just said is sense&mdash;good, plain common
sense&mdash;in fact, exactly the thing which one has no
use for in certain moods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrap the moods, Tony,&rdquo; said Henry, in an expressionless
voice.</p>
<p>Anthony laughed, rather harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good Henry,&rdquo; he said&mdash;there was affection
as well as mockery in his tone&mdash;&ldquo;does one ask for
one&rsquo;s temperament? Look here, I haven&rsquo;t seen
Raymond because I haven&rsquo;t dared&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what
I might do or say if I did see her. Now that is the
plain, unvarnished truth. When I was in Petrograd
I once hid for three days in a cellar with a temperamental
Russian lady. There was nothing to do except
to talk, and we talked endlessly. She told me a lot
of home truths&mdash;said my nature was like a glacier, cold
and slow, and that once I had got going I had to go on,
even if I ground all my own dearest hopes to powder
in doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, if you&rsquo;ve got a grouch, you&rsquo;re a
devil to keep it,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true; you
always were. But, look here, Tony, why all this to
my address? Why not get it off your chest to
Raymond, and if you <i>will</i> deal in geological parallels,
well&mdash;she&rsquo;s rather in the volcano line, or used to be,
and I don&rsquo;t mind betting she&rsquo;ll blow your glacier to
smithereens?&rdquo; Henry looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Think it over, Tony, and
same place, to-morrow, same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, without waiting for an answer, and
walked into the darkness of the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span></h2>
<p>Jane went to her room that night, but she did
not undress. Two entirely opposite lines of reasoning
had ended in inducing one and the same
decision. On the one hand, it might be argued that
Lady Heritage and Mr. Ember, having passed the
greater part of last night abroad upon their mysterious
business, would be most unlikely to spend a second
sleepless night so soon, and Jane might, therefore,
count on finding the coast clear for a little exploring
on her own account. On the other hand, an equally
logical train of thought suggested that these midnight
comings and goings might be part of a routine, and
that Jane, if on the watch, might acquire some very
valuable information.</p>
<p>She therefore locked her door and proceeded to
consider the question of what she should wear with
as much attention as if she had been going to a
ball. Neither barefoot nor with only stockings would
she go into any passage which had left those unpleasant
dark stains upon Lady Heritage&rsquo;s overall.
A really heartfelt shudder passed over her at the
very idea. No, Renata possessed slippers of maroon
felt. Misguided talent had stenciled upon the toe of
one a Dutch boy in full trousers, and upon the toe
of the other a Dutch girl in full petticoats. Jane
had a fierce loathing for the slippers, but they had
cork soles and would at once keep out the damp
and be very silent. She therefore placed them in
readiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Prolonged hesitation between the claims of the
crimson flannel dressing-gown and an aged blue
serge dress resulted in a final selection of the latter.
She decided that it would flap less, and that if it got
stained and damp the housemaids would be less likely
to notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, on the other hand,&rdquo; said Jane to herself,
&ldquo;if I&rsquo;m caught, it absolutely does in any excuse about
walking in my sleep, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an
earthly, anyhow. If I&rsquo;m caught, they&rsquo;ll jolly well
know what I was doing. The thing is not to be
caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At half-past eleven precisely she made her way down
to the hall.</p>
<p>To-night there was no patch of moonlight to pass
through, only a vague greyness which showed that the
moon had risen and that the clouds outside were thin
enough to let some of the light filter through.</p>
<p>Jane felt her way downstairs and across the hall to
Sir William&rsquo;s study. The study door afforded the nearest
point from which she could watch what she called
Willoughby Luttrell&rsquo;s corner without exposing herself
to detection.</p>
<p>She made up her mind that she would wait until she
heard twelve strike, and then explore the corner. She
had so thoroughly planned a period of waiting that it
was with a feeling of shocked surprise that she became
aware, even as she reached and crossed the threshold
of the study, that some one was coming down the stairs
behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>If she had been one moment later, if she had stayed,
as she very nearly did stay, to look out of the window
and see whether the night was fair, they would have
walked into one another at the top of the stairs. As
it was, she had escaped by the very narrowest margin.</p>
<p>The door opened inwards, and she had just time to
get behind it and close all but a crack, when through
that crack she saw Raymond Heritage pass, wrapped
in the same black cloak which she had worn the night
before, only this time she wore beneath it, not her linen
overall, but the dress she had worn for dinner. She
held an electric lamp in her left hand.</p>
<p>As soon as she had passed the door, Jane opened it a
little wider and came forward a step.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage went straight to the corner of the
hall. She put the torch down upon a chair which stood
immediately under Willoughby Luttrell&rsquo;s portrait.
Then she went quite close to the wall and reached up,
with her arms stretched out widely. Her right hand
touched the bottom left-hand corner of the portrait
and her left rested in the angle of the corner.</p>
<p>Jane heard the same click which she had heard the
night before.</p>
<p>Lady Heritage stepped back, took up her light, and,
going to the corner, pushed hard against the wall.</p>
<p>Jane watched with all her eyes, and saw a section of
the panelling turn on some unseen pivot, leaving a
narrow door through which Raymond passed. For a
moment she stared at the lighter oblong in the wall;
then there was a second click and the unbroken shadow
once again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Tingling with excitement, Jane stepped from her
doorway and came to the corner. She must, oh she
must, find the spring, and find it in time to follow.
Raymond stood here and reached up, but she was tall,
much taller than Jane. She stood on her tiptoes and
could not reach the lowest edge of the portrait.</p>
<p>With the very greatest of care she moved the chair
that was under the picture a yard or two to the left.
It weighed as though it were made of lead instead of
oak, and she was gasping as she set it down, but she
had made no noise. Renata&rsquo;s cork soles slipped as
she climbed on to the polished seat, but she gripped the
solid back and did not fall.</p>
<p>Raymond had pressed something in the wall with
both hands at once. Jane began to feel carefully
along the lower edge of the portrait until she came to
the massively foliated corner with its fat gilt acanthus
leaves. A cross-piece of the panelling came just on the
same level. She felt along it with light, sensitive finger-tips.
There was a knot in the wood, but nothing else.
&ldquo;If there is another knot in the corner, I&rsquo;ll try pressing
on them,&rdquo; she thought to herself, and on the instant
her left hand found the second knot. She pressed with
all her might, and for the third time that evening she
heard the little scarcely audible click. This time it
spelt victory.</p>
<p>In a curiously methodical manner Jane got down,
put the chair carefully back into its place, and pushed
against the wall as she had seen Lady Heritage do.
The panelling yielded to her hand and swung inwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>There was a black gap in the corner. Jane passed
through it without any hesitation, and pulled the panelling
to. She meant to leave it just ajar, but her hand
must have shaken, or else there was some controlling
spring, for as she stood in the black dark she heard the
click again. She drew a long breath and stood motionless
for a moment, but only for a moment. She had
come there to follow Raymond Heritage, and follow
her she would.</p>
<p>She put out a cautious foot and it went down, so far
down that for a sickening instant she thought that she
must overbalance and fall headlong; then, just in
time, it touched a step, the first of ten which went
down very steeply. At the bottom she felt her way
round a corner, and then with intensest thankfulness
she saw, a good way ahead, a moving figure with a
light.</p>
<p>The passage that stretched before her was about six
feet high and four feet wide. The air felt very damp
and heavy. At intervals there were openings on the
left-hand side where other passages seemed to branch
off. Jane began to have a growing horror of these other
passages. If she lost Lady Heritage, how would she
ever find her way back, and&mdash;yet more horrid thought&mdash;who,
or what, might at any moment come out of one
of those dark tunnels behind her? It was at this
point that she began to run, only to check herself
severely. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll hear you, you fool. Jane, I absolutely
forbid you to be such a fool; and Renata&rsquo;s
slippers will come off if you run, nasty sloppy things,
and then you&rsquo;ll tread in green slime, and get it between
all your toes. <i>It will squelch.</i>&rdquo; The horror of the
black passages was eclipsed; Jane stopped running
obediently, but she took longer steps and diminished
the distance between herself and her unconscious guide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>The passage had begun to run uphill. Jane
wondered where they were going. At any moment
Lady Heritage might turn. If she did so, Jane must
infallibly be caught unless she were near enough to
one of the side tunnels. She went on with her heart
in her mouth.</p>
<p>A line from one of Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s poems came
into her head:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Does the road wind uphill all the way?</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, to the very end.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sort of cheery thing one <i>would</i> remember,&rdquo;
thought Jane to herself; and she continued to climb
the endless slope, her eyes fixed on the dark, moving
silhouette of Lady Heritage.</p>
<p>At last there was a pause. The light ceased to
move. Jane crept closer, but dared not come too
near. Next moment she saw what looked like a slab
of stone in the passage wall swing round on a pivot as
the panelling had done. Lady Heritage passed out
of sight through the opening, and at the same moment
a great breath of wind from the sea drove into the
passage, clear, fresh, exquisite.</p>
<p>Jane hurried to the opening and looked out. She
saw first the dark, curving walls of a small cave, and,
immediately in front of her, the black outline of a
bench, beyond that a stretch of uneven ground, a
tangle of wire, and the black movement of the sea.
The moon behind the clouds made a vague, dusky
twilight, and the wind blew. Lady Heritage was
standing just on the other side of the stone seat. It
startled Jane to find that she was so near. She stood
quite still looking at the shadowed water and the
cloudy sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Then, without any warning, a tall, dark figure came
into sight. To Jane it seemed as if it rose out of the
ground. Afterwards she thought that, if any one
had been sitting on the grass and then had risen, it
would, of course, have looked like that. At the time
she leaned against the rock for support and had much
ado not to scream.</p>
<p>It was Lady Heritage who called out, with an inarticulate
cry that mingled with the wind and was
carried away.</p>
<p>The dark figure stood still just where it had so
suddenly appeared, and in an instant Raymond had
turned her light upon it. In the circle of light Jane
saw a man&mdash;a tall man, bareheaded. He had thrown
up his arm as if to screen his face, but it only hid the
mouth and chin. Over it his eyes looked straight
at Raymond Heritage.</p>
<p>And Raymond gave a great cry of &ldquo;Anthony!&rdquo;
The light dropped from her hand, fell with a crash on
the stones, rolled over, and went out. Anthony
Luttrell did not stir, but Raymond began to move
towards him after a strange rigid fashion, and as she
moved, she kept saying his name over and over:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony&mdash;Tony&mdash;Tony&mdash;Tony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice fell lower and lower. As she reached
him it was nearly gone.</p>
<p>Jane turned from the stone wall where she was
leaning, and stumbled back along the dark passage
with the tears running down her face.</p>
<p>At that last whisper of his name, Anthony spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a ghost, Raymond. Did you think I was?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>They were so close together that if she had stretched
out those groping hands another inch they would have
touched him. Something in his tone set a barrier
between them and Raymond&rsquo;s hands fell empty.
The world was whirling round her. Life and death,
love and hate, their parting and this meeting were
merged in a confusion that robbed her of thought
and almost of consciousness. It seemed to her as if
they had been standing there for a long, long time,
or, rather, as if time had nothing to do with them, and
they had been cast into a strange eternity. Out of
the turmoil of her thought arose the remembrance of
the last time she and Anthony had trysted in this
place&mdash;a sky almost unbearably blue and the sea
brilliant under the noonday sun. Now there was no
light anywhere.</p>
<p>Anthony was alive. That should have been joy
unbelievable. All through the years since she had
read his name in the list of missing with what an overwhelming
surge of joy would her heart have lifted to
the words, &ldquo;Anthony is alive.&rdquo; Now she said them to
herself and felt only a deeper, more terrible sense of
separation than any that had touched her yet. They
stood together, and between them there was a gulf
unpassable&mdash;and no light anywhere.</p>
<p>Raymond moved very slowly back along the way
that she had come. She came to the stone seat,
caught at the back of it with a hand that suddenly
began to shake, and sat down. A few slow moments
passed. Then she bent and began to grope for the
torch which she had dropped.</p>
<p>Anthony came towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, and she answered him in a
low, fluttering voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My light&mdash;I dropped&mdash;it&rsquo;s so dark&mdash;I want the
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong, capable hand groping without aim stirred
something in Anthony. He said, almost roughly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a moment later he had picked it up, found it
intact save for a crack in the glass, and, switching it
on, put it down on the seat beside her.</p>
<p>He was not prepared for her immediately flashing
the light on to his face. An exclamation broke from
him, and to cover it he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am changed out of knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changed&mdash;yes&mdash;Tony, that scar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice trembled away into silence. Her hand
fell. The dusk was between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugly, isn&rsquo;t it? But I haven&rsquo;t the monopoly of
change, have I? You, I think, have changed also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an impulse she hardly understood, she raised
the light and turned it until her face and her bare
throat were brilliantly illuminated. The dark cloak
fell away a little. The dark eyes looked at him with
defiance and appeal. Her beauty, seen like that, had
something that startled; it was so devoid of life and
colour, and yet so great! After a long, breathless
minute Anthony said in his slow voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have changed more than I have, Lady
Heritage, for you have changed your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the last vestige of colour leave her face.
She put the lamp down, and her silence startled
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would have known me,&rdquo; he said after a
pause that was all strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you,&rdquo; said Raymond very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because the lower part of my face was hidden.
You&rsquo;d have passed me in daylight. You have
passed me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>She winced at that, turned the light full on to him
again, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are working in the laboratory&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why....&rdquo; She broke off for a minute and went on with
a sort of violence, &ldquo;You say that I didn&rsquo;t know you,
but I did&mdash;I did. All this week I&rsquo;ve been tormented
with your presence. All this week I&rsquo;ve felt you just
at hand, just out of reach. I kept saying to myself,
&lsquo;Tony&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; and expecting to meet you round
every corner. It was driving me mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds most uncomfortable,&rdquo; said Anthony
dryly.</p>
<p>Raymond saw a mocking look pass over his face.
She turned the light away and set it down. If she had
not felt physically incapable of rising to her feet, she
would have left him then. This was not Anthony at
all, only the anger, the bitterness, the cold resentment
which she had hated in him. These, not Anthony, had
come back from the grave.</p>
<p>He was speaking again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t ask, but ... are you expecting
to meet any one here? Am I in the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered him with a sort of heartbroken simplicity
quite beyond pride:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I expected. You were haunting
me so. I came here because ... oh, Tony, don&rsquo;t you
remember at all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember something that you appear to have
forgotten, Raymond. When like a fool, and a dishonourable
fool at that, I gave you the secret of these
passages, I remember very well the rather enthusiastic
terms in which you asserted your conviction that the
secret was a sacred trust, and one that you would keep
absolutely inviolate. As, however, I broke my own trust
in giving you the secret, I can, I suppose, hardly complain
because you have imitated my lack of discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond did rise then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, what do you mean?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Raymond, you know very well what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo; Her voice had risen; this was more
the Raymond of their old quarrels, a creature quick to
passionate anger, vehement and reckless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you know very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say that I do not. That I haven&rsquo;t the
shadow of an idea&mdash;and that you must explain, Tony;
explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll explain all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last word was almost lost in a battering gust of
wind. He waited for it to die away, and then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon did you give away the secret to Ember?&rdquo;
he said, and heard her gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Jeffrey&mdash;you think I told Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony laughed. It needed only her use of Ember&rsquo;s
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you told Ember,&rdquo; he said in a voice
like ice.</p>
<p>Raymond put her hands to her head. She pressed
her throbbing temples and stared at this shadow of
Anthony. It was beyond any nightmare that they
should meet like this. She made a very great effort,
and came up to him, touching his wrist, trying to take
his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re thinking of. I
don&rsquo;t know how you can speak to me like this. I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t indeed. Since you went
I have only been into the passages twice, last night and
to-night. I went there because&mdash;oh, why do people go
and weep upon a grave? I had no grave to go to, but
I thought that, if I came here where we used to meet,
perhaps the you that was haunting me would take
shape so that I could see it, or else leave me. I felt
driven, and I didn&rsquo;t know what was driving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the breathless silence that followed she heard
him say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> that you told Ember&rdquo;&mdash;and quite suddenly
all the strength went out of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span></h2>
<p>When Jane turned, and ran back down the
dark passage, she had just the one thought&mdash;to
get away out of earshot. That she, or any one but
Anthony Luttrell, should have heard that breaking
tone in Raymond&rsquo;s voice shocked her profoundly.
She felt guilty of having intruded upon the innermost
sacred places of another woman&rsquo;s life. It shocked and
moved her very deeply. Tears blinded her, and she
ran into the dark without a thought for herself. It
was only when, looking back, she could not see even a
glimmer of outside twilight that she halted and began
to think what she must do.</p>
<p>The practical was never very long in abeyance with
Jane. She began to plan rapidly, even whilst she
dried her eyes. She would feel her way to the foot of
the stairs. If she kept touching the left-hand wall,
there would be very little risk of losing her way. Only
one passage had led off in that direction and that one
diverged at right angles, so that she would not run
the risk of going down it unawares. When she came
to the foot of the stairs, she would turn back again
and wait in the first cross-passage until Raymond
passed. Then she would follow her up the steps and
watch to see how the door opened on this side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Jane was very much pleased with her plan when
she had made it. It made her feel very intelligent
and efficient. She began to put it into practice at
once, walking quite quickly with her right hand feeling
in front of her and the left just brushing the wall.
Of course the stone was horrid to touch&mdash;cold, damp,
slimy. She was sure the slime was green. Once she
jabbed her finger on a rock splinter, and once she
touched something soft which squirmed. The dark
seemed to get darker and darker, and the silence was
like a weight that she could hardly carry.</p>
<p>Her little glow of self-satisfaction died down and
left her coldly afraid. Then, quite suddenly, she
came to the cross-passage. Her fingers slid from the
stone into black air, groped, stretched out, and touched&mdash;something&mdash;warm,
alive.</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s gasping scream went echoing down the dark.
A hand came up and caught her wrist, another fell
upon her right shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, hush!&rdquo; said Henry&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Jane caught her breath as if she were going to
scream again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, you utter, utter, <i>utter</i> beast!&rdquo; she said,
and incontinently burst into tears.</p>
<p>Henry put his arms round her, and Jane wept as
she had never wept in her life, her face tightly pressed
against the rough tweed of his coat sleeve, her whole
figure shaking with tumultuous sobs.</p>
<p>Presently, when she was mopping her eyes and feeling
quite desperately ashamed, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had just touched a slug, and you were worse.
I didn&rsquo;t think anything could be worse than a slug,
but you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry had kissed the back of her neck twice while
she was crying. Now he managed to kiss a little bit
of damp cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to,&rdquo; said Jane, in a muffled whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Henry, with the utmost simplicity.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind it, you know you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
He did it again. &ldquo;Jane, if you had minded, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have clung to me like that. Jane darling,
you do like me a little bit, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t! And I didn&rsquo;t cling, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did. Take it from me, you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane made a very slight effort to detach herself.
It was unsuccessful because Henry was a good deal
stronger than she was and he held her firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, I really hate you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Any one
might cling, if they thought it was a slug or Mr. Ember
and then found it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then, after a pause,
&ldquo;Henry, when a person says they hate you, it&rsquo;s
usual to let go of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My book of etiquette,&rdquo; said Henry firmly, &ldquo;says&mdash;page
163, para. ii.&mdash;&lsquo;A profession of hatred is more
compromising than a confession of love; a woman who
expresses hatred in words has love in her heart.&rsquo; And
I really did see that in a book yesterday, so it&rsquo;s bound
to be true, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, I told you to stop,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;I simply
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> be kissed by a man I&rsquo;m not engaged to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we are,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I mean you will,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane came a very little nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should quarrel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;quite dreadfully.
You know there are some people you feel you&rsquo;d never
quarrel with, not if you lived with them a hundred
years; and there are others, well, you know from the
very first minute that you&rsquo;d quarrel with them and
keep on doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like we&rsquo;re doing now?&rdquo; said Henry hopefully.
Jane nodded. Of course Henry could not see the
nod, but he felt it because it bumped his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All really happily married people quarrel,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The really hopeless marriages are the polite
ones. And you know you&rsquo;ll like quarrelling with me,
Jane. We&rsquo;ll make up in between whiles, and there
won&rsquo;t be a dull moment. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind promising to quarrel,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;No, Henry, you&rsquo;re positively not to kiss me any
more. I&rsquo;m here on business, if you&rsquo;re not. How
did you get here? And why were you lurking here,
pretending to be a slug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell me first,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;How
did <i>you</i> get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed Lady Heritage. I&rsquo;ve got an immense
amount to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned against Henry&rsquo;s arm in the darkness,
and spoke in a soft, eager voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really began yesterday. I woke up and couldn&rsquo;t
go to sleep again, so I came down for a book, and just
as I was at the drawing-room door, I saw Lady Heritage
come out of the corner by Willoughby Luttrell&rsquo;s
picture. Did you know there was a door there, Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went upstairs, and I was trying to screw up my
courage to cross the hall when Mr. Ember came down
the stairs and disappeared into the same corner. Of
course then I <i>knew</i> there must be a door there, so
I made up my mind to come down to-night and look
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, wait,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;You say Ember came
down the stairs and went through the door. Do you
think Lady Heritage left it open? Or do you think he
watched her come out, and then found the way for
himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;neither. I mean I&rsquo;m quite sure
it wasn&rsquo;t like that at all. She shut the door, for I heard
it, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t the first time Mr. Ember had
been that way. Why, he even put his light out before
he came to the wall, and any one would have to know
the way very well to find it in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went back to bed. Henry, you simply haven&rsquo;t
any idea how much I hated going up those stairs.
There was a perfectly fiendish patch of moonlight, and
I felt as if I couldn&rsquo;t go through it and perhaps be
pounced on by some one just round the corner. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for the housemaids finding me in the morning,
I believe I should just have stuck where I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s arm tightened a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to-night I hid in the study quite early, but
I had hardly got there when Lady Heritage came down.
I watched to see what she did, and as soon as she had
gone through the door and shut it, I hauled that great
heavy chair along and climbed on to it, and found the
spring. Your old secret door was made for much taller
people than me, and I was just dreadfully frightened
that some one would come and find me standing on the
chair in the corner, and looking like a perfect fool. Oh,
I <i>was</i> thankful when I really got into the passage and
found that Lady Heritage was still in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was frightfully clever of you,&rdquo; said
Henry, &ldquo;frightfully clever and frightfully brave; but
you&rsquo;re not to do it again. You might have run into
Ember or any one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do believe there&rsquo;s something dreadful
going on,&rdquo; said Jane quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about what I believe, but I know
that the passages are being used, and that they&rsquo;ve been
wired for electric light. I haven&rsquo;t explored them yet,
but people don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing for nothing.
Now go on. I may say that I saw Raymond pass, and
you after her. What happened next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She opened another
door, and went out&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s been puzzling me, but of
course I know now, the passage leads to the headland.
And the other day, when I was so frightened, Mr.
Patterson must have come out of it; and he was there
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on. Did they meet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, in a queer, shy voice. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
help hearing. I ran away at once, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
hearing her call him Tony. It&rsquo;s your cousin, Anthony
Luttrell, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Tony,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Thank the Lord
they&rsquo;ve met. I&rsquo;d just left him there after jawing him
about seeing Raymond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope they&rsquo;ve made it up,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;She
looked so dreadfully unhappy last night that I felt I
simply couldn&rsquo;t bear it. It&rsquo;s so dreadful to see people
hurt like that, and not be able to do anything. Do you
think they&rsquo;ll make it up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Henry not very hopefully.
&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s a queer sort of fellow, you know&mdash;frightfully
hard to move, and a perfect devil for hugging a grievance.
He&rsquo;s had a rotten time of it too. What with
Raymond marrying some one else, and then getting
knocked out himself, and coming round to find himself
a prisoner&mdash;well, there wasn&rsquo;t much to take his mind
off it. He escaped three times before he actually got
away, and then he went to Russia and had the worst
time of the lot. So that he&rsquo;s got a good deal of excuse
for sticking to his grouch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane suddenly pinched Henry very hard, put her
lips quite close to his ear, and breathed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke Henry drew her noiselessly back a yard
or two. The faint glow which Jane had seen brightened
until it seemed dazzling. The arched entrance to
the tunnel in which they stood became sharply defined.
The light struck the opposite wall, showing it rough
and black, with patches of dull green slime.</p>
<p>Instantly Jane felt that her finger-tips would never
be clean again. As the thought shuddered through her
mind the light went by. That&rsquo;s what it looked like,
the passing of a light. Raymond&rsquo;s dark figure hardly
showed behind it. The lighted archway faded. The
darkness spread an even surface over everything
again.</p>
<p>Jane laid her face against Henry&rsquo;s sleeve, pressed
quite close to him, and said in a little voice that
trembled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they haven&rsquo;t made it up&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d
have come with her if they had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of <i>course</i> he&rsquo;d have come with her. You wouldn&rsquo;t
have let me go by myself, you know you wouldn&rsquo;t.
No, they haven&rsquo;t made it up, they can&rsquo;t have, and&mdash;oh,
Henry, why do people quarrel like that? You won&rsquo;t
with me, will you&mdash;ever? I mean that dreadful
world-without-end sort. I couldn&rsquo;t bear it. You
won&rsquo;t, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane was shaking all over. Henry put his arms
round her very tight, laid his cheek against hers, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! It&rsquo;s a mug&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little while Jane said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go. You know she came to my room
before, and last night when I got back I found the door
shut. I had left it open so as not to make any noise,
but it was shut when I got back. That frightened me
more than anything, but now I think it must have
been the wind that shut it. I think so, only I&rsquo;m not
sure. It might have been the wind, or it might
have been ... somebody. It&rsquo;s much more frightening
not to be sure. So I&rsquo;d better go, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must go,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with
you and show you how to get out. And you must
promise me, Jane, that you won&rsquo;t come down here by
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I promise? I might have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;but I might have
to. Supposing they were murdering some one, and
I heard the screams? Or suppose I knew that they
were just going to blow the house up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Henry, with strong common sense, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see what good you&rsquo;d do by getting murdered and
blown up too, which is what it would come to. You
really must promise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry gave her an exasperated shake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jane,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the whole thing&rsquo;s
most infernally complicated. Tony&rsquo;s chucking his
job here, says he can&rsquo;t stand it, and I must go back
to town and see Piggy about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who on earth is Piggy?&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Julian Le Mesurier, my chief. Every one calls
him Piggy. I must see him about Tony, and I also
want to report what I told you about the passages
being wired and in use. I&rsquo;ll try and see Tony again
before I go. You see the thing is, I don&rsquo;t know how
far Raymond is involved, and I want to get her out
of the way. Tony&rsquo;s the only man who can get her
out of the way. I suppose I ought to go through
all the passages to-night, but I&rsquo;m not going to. I
shall tell Piggy why. As a matter of fact, he&rsquo;ll be
just as keen as I am on getting Raymond out of it.
Once she&rsquo;s clear, we can come down on Ember like
a cartload of bricks and smash up any devilry he may
have been contriving. Now do you see why you must
keep clear? I can&rsquo;t possibly do my job if I&rsquo;m torn in
bits about your running into danger. And next time
you went feeling along these passages you might really
run into your friend Ember, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t unless I&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t imagine I like green slime, and slugs, and the
pitch dark, do you? But I won&rsquo;t promise. Now I&rsquo;m
going. Good-bye, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an obstinate little devil, Jane,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>Jane gave a little gurgling laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t made an assignation yet,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;When are you coming back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve made an appointment with Tony for
to-morrow night, but I&rsquo;ll try and catch him now and
put that off for twenty-four hours. If for any reason
I have to come down sooner, I will come and tap on
your cupboard door. If I&rsquo;m not there by midnight
to-morrow, don&rsquo;t expect me. But I&rsquo;ll be there for
certain the following night&mdash;let me see, that&rsquo;s Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just supposing something prevented you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Henry cheerfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span></h2>
<p>Henry found Anthony Luttrell sitting on the
stone bench and so oblivious of his surroundings
that it needed a hand on his shoulder to rouse him.
Then he said vaguely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rouse up a bit, Tony. It might have been Mr.
Jeffrey Ember, you know. He was in the passages
last night, and, for all I know, he may be there every
night. I came back to say that I shan&rsquo;t be down
to-morrow. Make our appointment Sunday night
instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be out of this by then,&rdquo; said Anthony.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go sick if there&rsquo;s no other way. Stay here
another forty-eight hours I cannot, and will not. I
tell you I can&rsquo;t answer for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry gave an inward groan. Jane had evidently
been entirely right. They had not made it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen Raymond. I saw her pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen ... Lady Heritage. Henry, will you
tell me what the devil women are made of? She
seemed to expect to take things up exactly as if the last
seven years had never been at all, exactly as if there
had been no breach, no war, no John Heritage, and
no Jeffrey Ember. Oh, damn Jeffrey Ember!...&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you stood there and fired off sarcastic
remarks at the poor girl, instead of thanking
heaven for your luck. What&rsquo;s the good of brooding
over the past, Tony, and letting it spoil everything for
you now? Raymond cares a heap more for you than
you deserve, and if she&rsquo;s got into a mess, it&rsquo;s up to you
to get her out of it. After all, you don&rsquo;t want a
scandal, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get away. It&rsquo;s no good, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give Piggy your letter,&rdquo; Henry went on, &ldquo;and
tell him how you feel. He&rsquo;ll recall you all right.
But I know he&rsquo;s very strong on your coming to life
again. You ought to have done it ages ago; when
you came back from Russia, in fact. Look here,
Tony, be a reasonable being. Shave off your beard,
and take the artistic colour off that scar. Turn up
in London as yourself, and wire Raymond to come up
and meet you. I want her got away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get Piggy to wire to her, or her father.
There are a dozen ways in which it can be done. I
refuse quite definitely to have anything to do with it.
If Piggy hasn&rsquo;t recalled me by Monday, I shall simply
go. You can tell him that, if you like; and you can
tell him that I shall probably kill some one if I stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word he got up, walked round the
seat, and disappeared into the passage.</p>
<p>A little later Henry emerged from a cave upon the
seashore. There were a number of these caves, some
large, some small, under the far side of the headland.</p>
<p>The boundary of Luttrell Marches lay a quarter of a
mile behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Henry walked briskly along the shore, keeping close
to the cliff so that he might walk on rock instead of
shingle. Presently he left the beach and climbed a
steep zigzagging path. Twenty minutes&rsquo; walk brought
him to a small inn where he picked up his car and
drove away.</p>
<p>Next day in Sir Julian&rsquo;s room he unburdened himself
and delivered Anthony&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M, yes; I&rsquo;ll recall him,&rdquo; said Piggy frowning.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no good where he is, if that&rsquo;s his frame of mind.
But it&rsquo;s a pity&mdash;a pity. It bears out exactly what
I&rsquo;ve always said. He has extraordinary abilities;
I suppose he might have made a brilliant success in
almost any profession, but he&rsquo;s <i>impayable</i>.... I
don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve got a word for it in English ...;
he lacks the vein of mediocrity which I maintain is
indispensable&mdash;the faculty of being ordinary which, for
instance, you possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry blushed a little, and Sir Julian laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll send him abroad again. Of course
it&rsquo;s high time he came to life, as you say, if it&rsquo;s only
for the sake of getting you out of what must be an
extremely awkward position. My wife tells me that
match-making mammas of her acquaintance regard
you with romantic interest as the owner of Luttrell
Marches. Well, I&rsquo;ll see him when he comes up. Meanwhile,
I&rsquo;ve had Simpson&rsquo;s report. He says that,
according to reliable information, two men were concerned
in the sale of Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo; One is a man called
Belcovitch, the other, who seems to have kept in the
background, is described as a big good-looking man&mdash;florid
complexion, blue eyes, either English or American,
though he passed under the name of Bernier and
professed to be Swiss. Does that fit your friend Ember
by any chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;but it sounds very much like
Molloy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Molloy was supposed to have gone to the States,
wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piggy had been drawing a neat brick wall at the foot
of a sheet of foolscap. He now sketched in rapidly two
fighting cats. It was a spirited performance. Each
cat had wildly up-ended fur and a waving tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he and Ember told Miss Smith that he was
going to the States. I don&rsquo;t know that that goes for
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M, no,&rdquo; said Piggy. &ldquo;Well, Bernier passed
through Paris yesterday, and is in London to-day.
Belcovitch has gone to Vienna. Now, if Bernier is
Molloy, he&rsquo;ll probably communicate with Ember. I
was having him shadowed, of course, but the fool who
was on the job has managed to let him slip. I&rsquo;m
hoping to pick him up again, but meanwhile....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piggy was putting in the cats&rsquo; claws as he spoke, his
enormous hand absolutely steady over the delicate
curves and sharp points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more about Ember?&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>Sir Julian shook his head, and went on drawing.
&ldquo;He wore the white flower of a blameless life in Chicago,
and was absolutely unknown to the police,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a three-volume novel about Molloy,
though. You&rsquo;d better have it to read. Now you go off
and have some sleep, and ... er, by the way, if Miss
Smith ... what&rsquo;s her other name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if she wants to get away at any time, my
wife will be very pleased to put her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you awfully, sir,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>When he had gone, Sir Julian asked the Exchange
for his private number. He sat holding the receiver to
his ear and touching up his cats until Isobel&rsquo;s voice
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; dear, in the matter of Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Has anything happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the matter of Henry,&rdquo; said Piggy firmly, &ldquo;I
should say, from his conscious expression, that he had
brought it off. Her name is Jane Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I mayn&rsquo;t ask any questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one. I just thought you&rsquo;d better know her
name in case she suddenly arrived to stay with you.
That&rsquo;s all. I shall be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span></h2>
<p>It was not till next day that Jane missed her
handkerchief. When she reached her room
after saying good-bye to Henry she had rolled the
serge dress, the wet felt slippers and the damp stockings
into a bundle, and pushed them right to the back
of her cupboard. She was so sleepy that she hardly
knew how she undressed.</p>
<p>The instant her head touched the pillow, she slept,
a pleasant, dreamless sleep, and only woke with the
housemaid&rsquo;s knock.</p>
<p>It was when she was drinking a very welcome cup
of tea that she began to wonder whether she was
engaged to Henry or not. On the one hand, Henry
undoubtedly appeared to think that she was; on the
other, Jane felt perfectly satisfied that she had pledged
herself to nothing more formidable than a promise to
quarrel. A small but very becoming dimple appeared
in Jane&rsquo;s cheek as she came to the conclusion that
Henry was possibly engaged to her, but that she was
certainly not engaged to Henry. It seemed to her
to be a very pleasant state of affairs. It was, in fact,
with great reluctance that she transferred her thoughts
to more practical matters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Having dressed, she extracted the bundle of clothes
from the cupboard, and decided that the serge dress
might be hung up. There were one or two damp
patches and several green smears, but the former
would dry and the latter when dry would brush
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the slippers are awful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>They were; the cork soles sopping wet, the felt
drenched and slimy. She made a brown paper parcel
of them, and put it at the extreme back of the cupboard.
The stockings she consigned to the clothes
basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can wash them out later on,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>It was at this point that she missed her handkerchief.
She had had a handkerchief the night before. She
was sure of that, because she remembered drying her
eyes with it after she had cried.</p>
<p>A little colour came into her face at the recollection
of how vehemently she had wept on Henry&rsquo;s shoulder
with Henry&rsquo;s arm round her, but it died again at the
insistently recurring thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a handkerchief. I dried my eyes with it.
Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only had she dried her eyes with it, but after
that she remembered scrubbing the finger-tips that had
touched the slug. The handkerchief must be horribly
smeared and wet. It was one of Renata&rsquo;s, of course,
white with a blue check border, and &ldquo;R. Molloy, 12&rdquo;
in marking-ink across one corner. Imagine buying
twelve horrors like that! Mercifully Renata must
have lost most of them, for Jane had only inherited
four.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>She brought her thoughts back with a jerk. Where
was it? If she had dropped it in the house it would
have been either in the hall, on the stairs, or in the
corridor, and one of the housemaids would have
brought it to her by now. It must have fallen in the
cross-passage where she had stood with Henry, and if
it were found....</p>
<p>Jane moved a step or two backwards, and sat down
on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the first-class prize <i>idiots</i>!&rdquo; she said, and
there words failed her.</p>
<p>If she had dropped it in the cross-passage, it might
lie there until Sunday night when she could get Henry
to retrieve it, or it might not. Ember&mdash;Lady Heritage&mdash;Anthony
Luttrell, any one of these three people
might have business in that cross-passage, in which
case a handkerchief, even if stained, was just the most
unlikely thing in the world to pass unnoticed. Even
if no one went up that passage, it might be seen from
the main tunnel. Of course, if it were Anthony
Luttrell who found it, it would not matter. But it
was so very much more likely to be one of the others.</p>
<p>At intervals during the morning, Jane continued to
argue the question, or rather two questions. First,
the probabilities for and against the handkerchief
being discovered; and second, should she, or should
she not, go and look for it herself in defiance of Henry&rsquo;s
prohibition? She had spoken the truth, but not the
whole truth, when she told Henry that she hated the
idea of going into the passages alone. She hated
going, but she wanted to go. Most ardently she
desired to find things out before Henry found them
out. It would be nice and safe to sit with her hands
in her lap whilst Henry explored secret subterranean
caverns, and unravelled dangerous conspiracies&mdash;safe
but hideously dull. When Henry had finished exploring
and unravelling, he would come along frightfully
pleased with himself and want her to be engaged
to him, and he would always, always feel superior
and convinced that he had done the whole thing
himself. It was a most intolerable thought, more
intolerable than green slime and being alone in the
dark. It was at this point that Jane made up her
mind that she would go and look for her handkerchief
herself without waiting for Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Having made her decision, she found an unlooked-for
opportunity for carrying it out, for at lunch Lady
Heritage announced her intention of putting in several
hours of laboratory work, whilst it transpired that
Ember was going out in the two-seater car which he
drove himself, and that he was quite uncertain when
he would be back. Jane at once made up her mind
that, as soon as the coast was quite clear, she would
slip down into the passages. She would wait until
lunch had been cleared and the servants were safely
out of the way. No one was likely to come into the
hall, and the whole thing would be so much less
terrifying than another midnight expedition.</p>
<p>Ember excused himself before lunch was over, and
she heard him drive away a few minutes later; but
Lady Heritage sat on, her untasted coffee beside her.
She sat with her chin in her hand, looking out of the
window, and it was obvious enough that her thoughts
were far away. She was probably unconscious of
Jane&rsquo;s presence, certainly undesirous of it, and yet, for
the life of her, Jane could not have risen or asked if
she might go. Once or twice she looked from under
her lashes at Raymond&rsquo;s still white face. There was a
new look upon it since yesterday. She was sadder and
yet softer. She looked as if she had not slept at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>After a very long half-hour she turned her eyes on
Jane. There was a flash of surprise and then a
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have waited,&rdquo; she said in a cold voice,
and then got up and went out without another word.</p>
<p>Jane took a book into the hall and sat there.</p>
<p>Presently she caught a glimpse of Raymond&rsquo;s white
overall in the upper corridor, and heard the clang with
which the steel gate closed behind her. She sat quite
still and went on reading until all sounds from the
direction of the dining-room had ceased. Silence
settled upon the house, and she told herself that this
was her opportunity.</p>
<p>She ran up to her room, changed into the serge dress,
and put on a pair of outdoor shoes. She did not possess
an electric torch, and the question of a light had
exercised her a good deal. The best she could do was
to pocket a box of matches and one of the bedroom
candles which was half burnt down. She then went
downstairs, and, after listening anxiously for some
moments, she once more moved the heavy chair and,
climbing on it, began to feel for the knots on the panelling.
As her fingers found and pressed them, she
heard, simultaneously with the click of the released
spring, a faint thudding noise. With a spasm of
horror she knew that some one had passed through the
baize door that shut off the servants&rsquo; wing. The
sound she had heard was the sound of the door falling
back into place, and at any other moment it would have
gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>Fortunately for herself Jane was accustomed to a
rapid transition from thought to action. She was off the
chair, across the hall, and sitting with a book on her lap
when the butler made his usual rather slow entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>She had recognised at once that it would be impossible
for her to replace the chair and escape discovery.
It stood in the shadow, and she hoped for the best.</p>
<p>Blotson crossed the hall and disappeared into Sir
William&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>Jane gazed at a printed page upon which the letters
of the alphabet were playing &ldquo;General post.&rdquo; After
some interminable minutes Blotson reappeared. He
shut the study door, approached Jane, and in a low
and confidential voice inquired would she have tea in
the hall, the drawing-room, or the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the library,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;the library, Blotson.&rdquo;
And with a majestic, &ldquo;Very good, miss,&rdquo; Blotson
withdrew.</p>
<p>Blotson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Very good&rdquo; always reminded Jane of
the Royal Assent to an Act of Parliament. It was
doubtless a form, but how stately, how dignified a
form.</p>
<p>When the chill superinduced by the presence of
Blotson had yielded to a more natural temperature,
Jane went on tiptoe across the hall and replaced the
chair. It was a comfort to reflect that it had escaped
Blotson&rsquo;s all-embracing eye. With a hasty glance she
swung the panel inwards, slipped through, and closed
it again.</p>
<p>She descended all the steps before she ventured to
light her candle, and she was careful to put the spent
match into her pocket. Renata&rsquo;s dress really did have
a pocket, which, of course, made the dropping of the
handkerchief quite inexcusable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The passage was much less terrifying when one had
a light of one&rsquo;s own instead of the distant glimmer of
somebody else&rsquo;s and the horrid possibility of being
left at any moment in total darkness, with no idea of
one&rsquo;s whereabouts or of how to get out.</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s spirits rose brightly. To dread a thing and
then to find it easy provides one with a pleasant sense
of difficulty overcome. In great cheerfulness of spirit
Jane walked along until she came to the cross-passage
on her right. She turned up it, walked a few steps
holding her candle high, and there, a couple of yards
from the entrance, lay the handkerchief rolled into a
wet and very dirty ball. She picked it up gingerly, and
put it into her convenient pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose I ought to go back at once; but
what a waste, when every one is safely out of the way,
and I&rsquo;ve got through the really horrid part, which is
opening that abominable spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane hesitated, weighing the duty of a swift return
against the pleasure of exploring and perhaps getting
ahead of Henry. The recollection that Henry had
forbidden her to explore turned the scale&mdash;towards
pleasure.</p>
<p>She had four inches of candle and a whole box of
matches. She had at least two hours of liberty, and,
most important of all, she felt herself to be in a frame
of mind which invited success. The question was
where to begin.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side there was only this single
passage. Jane did not feel attracted by it. She was
almost sure that it must lead to the potting-shed,
and to descend from conspiracies to garden lumber
would indeed be an anti-climax.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>On the left there were four passages. Jane walked
back along the way she had come. The first passage
left the main tunnel at an acute angle which obviously
carried it back under the main block of the house.
Jane decided to explore it. She held her candle high
in one hand and her skirts close with the other. The
passage was low, and she had to bend a little. After
half a dozen yards she came to a flight of steps. They
were wet, slippery, and very steep. Jane stood on
the top step and looked down.</p>
<p>The walls oozed moisture, the candlelight showed
her a pale slug about five inches long&mdash;Jane said six to
start with, but, under pressure from Henry, retreated
as far as five and would not yield another half-inch;
she also said that the slug waved its horns at her and
was crawling in her direction. Right there, as the
Americans say, she made up her mind that this would
be a good passage to explore with Henry, later on.
She caught a glimpse of another slug on a level with
the fifth step, whisked round, and ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>one</i> point about slugs is that they can&rsquo;t run,&rdquo;
she said as she came back into the main corridor.</p>
<p>Without giving herself time to think, she plunged
into the next opening on the left. It ran at right
angles to the central passage, and was comparatively
dry. It kept on the same level too, and Jane, trying
to make a mental plan, thought that it must run under
the house, cutting across the north wing. It occurred
to her that there might be vaults of some kind under
the terrace, and that this passage would perhaps lead
to them. If this were so, it must soon either curve
gradually to the left or take a sudden sharp turn. She
wished she had thought of counting her steps, but it
was difficult to pace regularly on a slippery floor and
in such a poor light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Just as she had begun to think that the passage
must run out to sea, she came to the sharp turn which
she had expected. A wall of black rock faced her, to
her right a tunnel ran in at a sharp angle, and to her
left there was a dark stone arch, a few feet of a new
sort of tunnel built of brick, and then a steel gate
exactly like the gates which shut off the laboratories
in the house above.</p>
<p>Jane stared at the gate as if she expected it to
dissolve into the surrounding darkness. The candle-light
danced on the steel. It was rusty, but not so
very rusty, and therefore it could not have been for
very long in its present position. She came closer
and touched it. It was real.</p>
<p>Her amazing good fortune almost overcame her.
What a thing to tell Henry! What a justification
for flouting his orders!! <i>What a score!!!</i></p>
<p>Jane transferred the candle to her left hand, put
out a right hand which trembled with excitement,
and tried the gate. It was open. For a moment
she drew back. Like the child who sits looking at a
birthday parcel, the mere sight of which provides
it with so many thrills that it cannot bring itself to
cut the string and unwrap the paper, Jane stood and
looked at her gate, her discovery&mdash;hers, not Henry&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As she looked, her eyes were caught by a small knob
on the right-hand wall. It was about four feet above
the floor and quite close to the steel bars. It was
made of some dull metal and looked exactly like an
electric-light switch. By going quite close to the
gate and looking through she could see that a cased
wire ran along the bricks on the same level, and she
remembered that Henry had said the passages were
wired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Had Henry been first on the field after all? She
turned, held her light high, and looked back. The
wire went up to the roof and ran along until she lost
it in the darkness. She reflected hopefully that Henry
might have seen the wire much farther along, and
turned back again.</p>
<p>Her fingers were on the switch when a really dreadful
thought pricked her. Suppose the switch controlled
some horrible explosive! It might turn on a light,
most likely it did; but, on the other hand, it might
let loose a raging demon of destruction that would
blow the whole place to smithereens. It was an unreasonable
thought, the sort of thought that one
dismisses instantly in the daylight, but which by
candlelight in an underground tunnel assumes a certain
degree of credibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is, am I going on or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence having failed to supply her with an
answer, she said viciously, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a worse rabbit
than Renata,&rdquo; shut her eyes, held her breath, and
jerked the switch down.</p>
<p>Through her closed lids came a red flash. She clung
to the switch and waited. A drop of boiling wax
guttered down upon her left forefinger. She opened
her eyes and saw the steel gate like a black tracery
against a lighted space beyond. With a quickly
drawn breath of relief she pushed the steel gate, took
one step forward, and then stood rigid, listening to the
muffled yet insistent whir of an alarm bell. After
one horrified moment she pulled the door towards her
again. The sound ceased. Jane considered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>As a result of her consideration she turned out the
electric light, opened the gate, slipped through, and
closed it again so quickly that the bell was hardly
heard. She did not allow it to latch, and, stooping,
set a piece of broken brick to hold it ajar. The
candlelight seemed very inadequate, but she decided
that she must make it do, and holding it well up in
front of her, she came through a brick arch into a
long chamber with walls of stone.</p>
<p>Jane looked about her with ignorant, widely opened
eyes. She had never been in a laboratory, but she
knew that this must be one. The printed page does
not exist for nothing. The vague yellow light flickered
on strange cylindrical shapes and was flung back by
glass jars and odd twisted retorts. A great many
appliances, for which she could find no name, emerged
from dense shadow into the uncertain dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a medi&aelig;val torture chamber&mdash;only worse,
colder&mdash;more calculating! It&rsquo;s a sort of torture
chamber. I <i>hate</i> it. It gives me the grues,&rdquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>She moved slowly down the room. It was quite
dry in here. There was no slime, and there were
no slugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate it a thousand times more than the passages,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>Her feet moved slowly and unwillingly. In the far
corner there were two more arches. She thought she
would just see what lay beyond them and then return.
She took the one on the right hand first. It ran along
a little way and then terminated in a small round
chamber which was full of packing-cases. She returned
and went down the second passage. She was just
inside it when with startling suddenness she found
herself looking at her own shadow. It lay clear and
black on the brick floor in front of her. Some one had
turned on the electric light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s candle tilted and the wax dropped. Her
horrified eyes looked about wildly for a place of refuge.
The light showed her one. Within a yard of the
entrance there was an arched hollow. With a sort of
gasp she blew her candle out and bolted for the shelter.
The whir of the electric bell sounded as she gained it,
sounded and then ceased. She heard Ember say,
&ldquo;Quite a good run, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and a voice which
she did not expect answer, &ldquo;Well enough.&rdquo; The
voice puzzled her. It was a pleasant voice, deep and
rich. It had something of a brogue and something of
a twang.</p>
<p>A most unpleasant light broke upon Jane. It was
the voice of the Anarchist Uncle. It was the voice of
Mr. Molloy.</p>
<p>Jane got as far back into her hollow as she could.
It was not very far. There had evidently been a
tunnel here, but the roof had fallen in, and the floor
was rough and uneven with the d&eacute;bris.</p>
<p>She heard the two men moving in the room beyond,
and she experienced a most sincere repentance for not
having attended to the counsels of Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we can talk,&rdquo; said Ember. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got the cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with me,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just in case....&rdquo;&mdash;a not unmelodious
whistle completed the sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They paid the higher figure?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;They did,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy. &ldquo;Belcovitch was for
taking their second bid, but I told him &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Belcovitch
has his points, but he&rsquo;s not the bold bargainer. I told
him &lsquo;No.&rsquo; I told him &lsquo;It&rsquo;s this way&mdash;if they want it
they&rsquo;ll pay our price.&rsquo; And pay it they did. I don&rsquo;t
know that I ever handled that much money before, and
all for a sheet or two of paper. Well, well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have brought the money with you.
Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the now brightly lighted laboratory Molloy sat
negligently on the end of a bench and lifted his eyebrows
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a place of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve pulled it off,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By the way,
the fact of the sale is known. We&rsquo;ve had an interfering
young jack-in-office down here making inquiries, and
Sir William has gone up to town in a very considerable
state of nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Anarchist Uncle,&rdquo; said Jane to herself, &ldquo;has
been selling the Government Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo; He doesn&rsquo;t
trust Mr. Ember enough to hand the money over.
Pleasant relations I&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy whistled again, a long-drawn note with a hint
of dismay in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who let the cat out of the bag,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;These things always leak out. It doesn&rsquo;t really
signify. With this money at our command we can
complete our arrangements at once, and be ready to
strike within the next few weeks. You and Belcovitch
had better keep out of the way until the time comes.
He should be here in four days&rsquo; time, travelling by the
route we settled; then you&rsquo;ll have company. You
must both lie close here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the devil of a plan now, Ember,&rdquo; said Molloy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be no better than rats in a drain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s for your safety,&rdquo; said Ember. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
out for blood over this business of Formula &lsquo;A,&rsquo; I
can tell you, and there&rsquo;s nowhere you&rsquo;d be half so
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane was listening with all her ears. She decided
that Mr. Ember&rsquo;s solicitude was not all on Molloy&rsquo;s
account. &ldquo;He thinks that if Molloy and Belcovitch
are arrested, they&rsquo;ll give him away over the big thing
in order to save themselves. I expect they&rsquo;d be able to
make a pretty good bargain for themselves, really.&rdquo;
She heard Molloy give a sulky assent. Then Ember
was speaking again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to check the lists with you. Not the continental
ones&mdash;I&rsquo;ll keep those for Belcovitch&mdash;but those
for the States and here. I&rsquo;ve got them complete now,
but I&rsquo;m not very sure about all the names. Hennessey
now, he&rsquo;s down for Chicago, but I don&rsquo;t know that I
altogether trust Hennessey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late in the day to say that,&rdquo; said Molloy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about Hayling Taylor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane listened, and heard name follow name. Ember
appeared to be reading from a list. He would name a
large town and follow it with a list of persons who
apparently acted as agents there. Sometimes these
names were passed with an assenting grunt by Molloy,
sometimes there was a discussion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>There are a great many large towns in the United
States of America. Jane became stiffer and stiffer.
At last she could bear her constrained half-crouching
position no longer. Very gingerly, moving half an inch
at a time, she let herself down until she was sitting
on the pile of broken bricks which blocked the tunnel.
The names went on. It was dull and monotonous to a
degree, but behind the dullness and the monotony there
was a sense of lurking horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being in a fog,&rdquo; said Jane&mdash;&ldquo;the sort you
can&rsquo;t see through at all, and knowing that there&rsquo;s a
tiger loose somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing became clearer and clearer to her. Those
lists that sounded like geography lessons must be got
hold of somehow. Henry must have them.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a long time Ember folded
up one paper and produced another. If Jane had been
able to watch Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s face, she would have
noticed that, every now and then, it was crossed by a
look of hesitation. He seemed constantly about to
speak and yet held his peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to check the names for Ireland too,&rdquo;
said Ember. &ldquo;Grogan sent me the completed list two
days ago. You&rsquo;d better look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy took the paper and ran his finger down
the names, mumbling them only half audibly. His
finger travelled more and more slowly. All at once
he stopped, and threw the paper from him along the
bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Ember, in his cool tones.</p>
<p>Molloy frowned, got up, walked to the end of the
room, and came back again. He appeared to have
something to say, and to experience extreme difficulty
in saying it. His words, when he did speak, seemed
irrelevant:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big sum they paid us for Formula &lsquo;A,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Did you ever handle as much money as that,
Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jeffrey Ember, short and sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. It&rsquo;s a queer thing the feeling it gives
you. I tell you I came across with fear upon me, not
knowing for sure whether I&rsquo;d get away with it; but
there was a lot besides fear in it. There was power,
Ember, I tell you&mdash;power. Whilst I&rsquo;d be sitting in the
train, or walking down the street, or lying in my bed
at an hotel, I&rsquo;d be thinking to myself, I&rsquo;ve got as
much as would buy you up, and then there would
be leavings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you driving at, Molloy?&rdquo; said Ember.</p>
<p>Molloy&rsquo;s florid colour deepened. He narrowed his
lids and looked through them at Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a
proverb we might take note of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a proverb,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
in my mind since I had the handling of the money&mdash;&lsquo;A
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember&rsquo;s eyes lost their dull film. They brightened
until Mr. Molloy was unable to sustain their glance.
He shifted his gaze, and Ember said very quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking of selling us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy broke into an oath. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a thing no
one shall say of me,&rdquo; he said, with a violence that sent
his voice echoing along through the open arches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may I ask you what you meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just this.&rdquo; Molloy dropped to an ingratiating
tone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money safe&mdash;certain&mdash;in our
hands now. What&rsquo;s the need of all this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>He came forward with two or three great strides,
picked up the list from where he had thrown it, and
beat with it upon his open hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this,&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;&ldquo;this and what it stands
for. You may say there&rsquo;s no risk, but there&rsquo;s a big
risk. It&rsquo;s a gamble, and what&rsquo;s the need to be
gambling when we&rsquo;ve got the money safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In plain English, you want to back out at the last
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, and I defy you to say that I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s come to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s come to me. It came to
me when I ran me eye down this list. See there, and
that&rsquo;ll tell ye what has come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust the list in front of Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Galway you&rsquo;ve got set down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what of it?&rdquo; said Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy. &ldquo;I was born in
Galway, and the only sister I ever had is married there.
Four sons she has, decent young men by all the
accounts I&rsquo;ve had of them. If I haven&rsquo;t been in Galway
for thirty years, that&rsquo;s not to say that I&rsquo;ve no feeling
for my own flesh and blood. Why, the first girl I
ever courted lived out Barna way. Many&rsquo;s the time
I&rsquo;ve met her in the dusk on the seashore, and she half
crying for fear of what her father would do. Katie
Blake her name was. They married her to old Timmy
Dolan before I&rsquo;d been six months out of the country. A
fistful of gold he had, and a hard fist it was. I heard
tell he beat her, poor Katie. But ye see now, Ember,
it&rsquo;s the same way with your native place and your first
love, ye can&rsquo;t get quit of them. Now I hadn&rsquo;t been a
month in Chicago before I was courting another girl,
but to save my neck I couldn&rsquo;t tell ye what her name
was, and ye may blow Chicago to hell to-morrow and
I&rsquo;ll not say a word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;But not Galway?&rdquo; Mr. Ember&rsquo;s tone was very
dry indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said it. Not Galway. I&rsquo;ll not stand for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember laughed. It was a laugh without merriment,
cool, sarcastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molloy, the man of sentiment!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now
doesn&rsquo;t it strike you that it&rsquo;s just a little late in the
day for this display of feeling? May I ask why you
never raised the interesting subject of your birthplace
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it sentiment that you&rsquo;re sarcastic about?&rdquo;
said Molloy. &ldquo;If it is, I&rsquo;d have you remember that
I&rsquo;ve never let it interfere with business yet, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t now. Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve put my feelings
on one side when I was up against a business proposition.
But I tell you right here that when I see
my way to good money and to keeping what I call my
sentiment too it looks pretty good to me, and I say to
myself what I say to you, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the sense of going
looking for trouble?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will translate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From the sale of the
Government formula you see your way to deriving a
competency. You become, in a mild way, a capitalist.
Luxuries before undreamed of are within your grasp&mdash;romantic
sentiment, childhood&rsquo;s memories, the finer
feelings in fact. As a poor man you could not dream of
affording them, though I dare say you&rsquo;d have enjoyed
them well enough. Is it a correct translation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Molloy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Molloy the capitalist!&rdquo; Ember&rsquo;s voice dropped
just a little lower. &ldquo;Molloy the man of sentiment!
Molloy the traitor! No you don&rsquo;t, Molloy, I&rsquo;ve got
you covered. Why, you fool, you don&rsquo;t suppose I
meet a man twice my own size in a place that no one
knows of without taking the obvious precautions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy had first started violently, and next made a
sort of plunge in Ember&rsquo;s direction. At the sight of
the small automatic pistol he checked himself, backed
a pace or two, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take that word back. It&rsquo;s a damned lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He breathed hard and stared at the pistol in Ember&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Ember coolly. &ldquo;I hope it is, for your
sake. I&rsquo;d remind you, Molloy, that no one would
move heaven and earth to find you if you disappeared,
and that it would be hard to find a handier place for
the disposal of a superfluous corpse. Now listen to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set his left hand open on the lists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going through. It&rsquo;s going through in
every detail. It&rsquo;s going through just as we planned
it.&rdquo; He spoke in level, expressionless tones. He
looked at Molloy with a level, expressionless gaze. A
little of the colour went out of the big Irishman&rsquo;s face.
He drew a long breath, and came to heel like a dog
whose master calls him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was just
talk, and to see what you thought of it. If you&rsquo;re
set on the plan, why the plan it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all committed to the plan,&rdquo; said Ember.
&ldquo;You were talking a while ago as if you and I could
do a deal and leave the rest of the Council out. Setting
Belcovitch on one side, weren&rsquo;t you forgetting to
reckon with Number One?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was,&rdquo; said Molloy. &ldquo;And come to that,
Ember, when are we to have the full Council meeting
you&rsquo;ve been talking of for months past? Belcovitch
and I had a word about it, and he agrees with me.
We want a full meeting and Number One in the chair
instead of getting all our instructions through you.
It&rsquo;s reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s reasonable.&rdquo; Ember paused, and then
added, &ldquo;You shall have the full Council when Belcovitch
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane on her pile of d&eacute;bris leaned forward to catch
the words. Ember&rsquo;s voice had dropped very low.
She was shaking with excitement. Her movement
was not quite a steady one. A small piece of rubble
slid under the pressure she placed on it. Something
slipped and rolled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Ember sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more of the passage falling in,&rdquo; said Molloy,
&ldquo;by the sound of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take a light and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been a rat,&rdquo; said Molloy carelessly.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Jane remained absolutely
motionless. If they thought it was a rat perhaps
they would not come and look. She stiffened herself,
wondering how long she could keep this cramped
position. Then, with a spasm of terror, she heard
Molloy say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look round. We don&rsquo;t want
rats in here,&rdquo; heard his heavy footfall, and saw a
brilliant beam of light stream past the entrance of her
hiding-place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Before she had time to do more than experience a
stab of fear, Molloy walked straight past. She heard
him go up the passage, heard him call out, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing here.&rdquo; Then he turned. He was coming
back. Would he pass her again? It was just
possible. She tried to think he would, and then she
knew that he would not. The light flashed into the
broken tunnel mouth. It flashed on the sagging roof,
the damp walls and the broken rubble. It flashed on
to Jane.</p>
<p>Jane saw only a white glare. She knew exactly
what a beetle must feel like when it is pinned out as a
specimen. The light went through and through her.
It seemed to deprive her of thought, volition, power to
move. She just stared at it.</p>
<p>Mr. Molloy using his flashlight cheerfully, and much
relieved at a break in his conversation with Ember,
received one of the severest shocks of his not unadventurous
life. One is not a Terrorist for thirty
years without learning a little elementary self-control
in moments of emergency. He did not therefore
exclaim. He merely stared. He saw a sagging roof
and damp walls. He saw a muddled heap of broken
bricks unnaturally clear cut and distinct. He saw the
shadows which they cast, unnaturally black and hard.
He saw Jane, whom he took to be his daughter Renata.
His brain boggled at it. He passed his hand across his
eyes, and looked again. His daughter Renata was
still there. She was half sitting, half crouching on the
pile of rubble. Her body was bent forward, her elbows
resting on her knees, her hands one on either side of
her colourless cheeks. Her face was tilted a little
looking up at him. Her mouth was a little open. Her
eyes stared into the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Jane stared, and Mr. Molloy stared. Then, with a
sudden turn he swung round and passed back into
the laboratory. As he went he whistled the air of
&ldquo;The Cruiskeen Lawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane remained rigid. The beetle was unpinned.
The light was gone. But the darkness was full of
rockets and Catherine-wheels. Her ears were buzzing.
From a long way off she heard Ember speak and
Molloy answer. The rockets and the Catherine-wheels
died away. She put her head down on her knees, and
the darkness came back restfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span></h2>
<p>The clang of the steel gate was the next really
distinct impression which Jane received. In
a moment she was herself. It was just as if she
had been asleep, and then, to the jar of a striking
clock, had come broad awake. She listened
intently.</p>
<p>That clang meant that the gate had been shut. One
of the men had gone, probably Ember. One of them
certainly remained, for she could see that the lights
in the laboratory were still on. If it were Molloy, he
would come and find her. But it was just possible that
it was Jeffrey Ember who had remained behind, so
she must keep absolutely still, she knew.</p>
<p>At this moment Jane felt that she had really had
as much adventure as she wanted for one day. She
thought meekly of Henry, and soulfully of her tea.
Blotson would be laying it in the library. There would
be muffins. She was dreadfully thirsty. Jane could
have found it in her heart to weep. The thought of the
slowly congealing muffins unnerved her. She would
almost have admitted that woman&rsquo;s place is in the
home. There is no saying what depths she might not
have arrived at, had the return of the Anarchist Uncle
not distracted her thoughts. The heavy tread convinced
her that it was not Mr. Ember, but she did not
stir until he came round the corner and flashed the
light upon her face. Jane blinked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Niagara!&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy. &ldquo;It was the
fright of my life you gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane scrambled to her feet. She was not quite sure
what the situation demanded of her in the way of filial
behaviour. Did one embrace one&rsquo;s Anarchist Parent?
Or did one just lean against the wall and look dazed?
She thought the latter.</p>
<p>Molloy turned the light away, and then flashed it
back again with great suddenness. Jane shut her
eyes. Mr. Molloy pursed his lips and emitted a whistle
which travelled rapidly up the chromatic scale and
achieved a top note of piercing intensity. Without a
word he took Jane by the arm and brought her out of
her hiding-place into the lighted laboratory. He then
pushed her a little away, took a good look at her, and
repeated his former odd expletive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Niagara!&rdquo; he said in low but heartfelt
tones.</p>
<p>Jane felt a little giddy, and she sat down on the
bench. Her right hand went out, feeling for support,
and touched a sheaf of papers. Through all the confusion
of her thought she recognised that these must be
the lists from which Ember had been reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said faintly.</p>
<p>Molloy put down his electric torch, came quite close
to her, bent down with a hand on either knee until
his face was on a level with hers, and said in what he
doubtless intended for a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>where</i> is me daughter Renata?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Jane leaned back so as to get as far away from the
flushed face as possible. She opened her mouth
without knowing what she was going to say, and quite
suddenly she began to laugh. She leaned her head
against the brick wall behind her, and the laughter
shook her from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be to God, is it a laughing matter?&rdquo; said
Mr. Molloy; &ldquo;whisht, I tell you, whisht, or you&rsquo;ll
be having Ember back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He straightened himself, and made a gesture in the
direction of the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy she is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jane put her hand to her throat, gasped for breath,
and stopped laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was&mdash;you were&mdash;I
mean, what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, where is me daughter Renata?&rdquo; said Molloy
in his deepest tones.</p>
<p>Jane gulped down a gurgle of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter Renata?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me daughter Renata,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Molloy
sternly. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane felt herself steadying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think&mdash;what makes you think&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re not my daughter? They say it&rsquo;s a
wise child that knows its own father, but it&rsquo;s a damn
fool father that wouldn&rsquo;t know his own daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i> do you know?&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>Molloy laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s telling,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you. You&rsquo;re my niece Jane Smith and not my
daughter Renata Molloy; and, even if I wasn&rsquo;t her
father, I&rsquo;d always know you from Renata, the way I
could always tell your two mothers apart when no one
else could. Your mother had a little mole on her
left eyelid, just in the corner where it wouldn&rsquo;t show
unless she shut her eyes. My wife hadn&rsquo;t got it, and
that&rsquo;s the way I could always tell her from her sister.
And my daughter Renata hasn&rsquo;t got it, but you have;
and when you blinked, in yonder, I got a glimpse of
it; and when I flashed the light on to you again and
you shut your eyes, I made sure. And now, perhaps
you&rsquo;ll tell me where in all the world is Renata?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s gaze rested intelligently upon Mr. Molloy.
The corners of her mouth lifted a little. The dimple
showed in her left cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata,&rdquo; she said in a very demure voice, &ldquo;is in
a safe place, like the money you went abroad for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy looked at her uncertainly; in the end he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you won&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning that I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll tell you or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it would be better if I didn&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;re thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was what I was thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy. Then he laughed
again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve the joke on Ember anyhow,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s got a patent for most of the brains in
the country, and here he&rsquo;s been led by the nose by a
slip of a girl just out of school. And what&rsquo;s more,
he was taken in and I wasn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;ll find that hard to
swallow, will Mr. Jeffrey Ember. You&rsquo;d not have
taken me in, you know, even if I&rsquo;d not had the mole
to go by. And one of these fine days I shall twit
Ember with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so sure you&rsquo;d have known me?&rdquo; said
Jane. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy, &ldquo;if you knew your
cousin Renata, you&rsquo;d not be asking me that. If I
find a girl in an underground passage all in the dark,
well, that girl is not my daughter Renata. And if,
by any queer sort of chance, Renata had been in that
hole where I found you, she&rsquo;d have screamed blue
murder when I turned the light on her. Then, at
an easy guess, I should say you had Renata beat to a
frazzle in the matter of brains. I&rsquo;m not saying, mind
you, that I&rsquo;m an admirer of brains in a woman. It&rsquo;s
all a matter of opinion, and there&rsquo;s all sorts in the
world. But you&rsquo;ve got brains, and Renata hasn&rsquo;t,
and Ember&rsquo;s had you under his nose all this time
without ever knowing the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t exactly obtrude my superior
intelligence on Mr. Ember,&rdquo; she said. Her eyes
danced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how stupid I can be when
I try, and I&rsquo;ve been trying very hard indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you have?&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy. &ldquo;Well,
you had Ember deceived and that&rsquo;s a grand feather
in your cap, I can tell you. He&rsquo;s a hard one to deceive
is Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane gurgled suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I deceived you,
too. Yes, I did, I really did. You know the morning
you went off to America, or rather the morning you
went off <i>not</i> to America? At the flat? You said
good-bye to me, not to Renata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where was Renata then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the safe place,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear it was Renata the night before,&rdquo; said
Molloy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s clever of you. It was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Molloy was thinking hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which of you was it in the night when we
thought the roof had fallen in, and came into Renata&rsquo;s
room to look out of the window? I&rsquo;d my heart in my
mouth, for I thought it was a bomb. Was it you
or Renata sitting up in bed like a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was me,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have
been nearly so frightened as I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you changed places between eight and eleven
that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We changed places,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;just as you and
Mr. Ember came home. I shut Renata&rsquo;s door just
as you opened the door of the flat. I was in the hall
when the lift stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I know how you did it,&rdquo; said Molloy.
He seemed interested. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to know who
put you up to it; and I&rsquo;d like to know who gave the
back entrance away; and I&rsquo;d like to know how Renata,
who hasn&rsquo;t the nerve of a mouse, got down that blamed
fire-escape alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane dimpled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do want to know a lot, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then Jane said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, what happens next, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Molloy, &ldquo;is just what I&rsquo;m wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be getting back, I think,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ought you now?&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>There was another pause. Jane thought she would
leave Mr. Molloy to break it this time. She sat considering
him. Her eyes dwelt upon him with a calm
scrutiny which he found extremely embarrassing. The
longer it continued, the more embarrassing he found
it. In the end he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to let you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not tell Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane gave another nod, cool and brief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the devil&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo; said Molloy, with sudden
violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need the devil; you&rsquo;ve got Mr. Ember,&rdquo;
said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true enough, for it&rsquo;s the very devil
and all he is, and, if I let you go, I&rsquo;ll have him to
reckon with&mdash;some day. I&rsquo;d rather face the Day of
Judgment myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what I think,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I think Mr.
Ember is mad. That is to say, I think he is the sort of
fanatic who sees what he wants and sets out to get
it, without knowing half the difficulties and obstacles
that block the way. When he does begin to know
them he doesn&rsquo;t care, he just goes along blind. Where
a reasonable man would alter his plan to suit the circumstances,
this sort of fanatic just goes on because
he&rsquo;s made his plan and will stick to it whatever
happens. He isn&rsquo;t governed by reason at all. He
doesn&rsquo;t care what risks he runs, or what risks he makes
other people run. He goes right on, whatever happens.
If the next step is over a precipice he&rsquo;ll take it. He
must go on. Mr. Ember is like that. I think he is
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Molloy stared hard at Jane, then he nodded
slowly three times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re not like that,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
reasonable. You don&rsquo;t want to run appalling risks
when there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to be gained by it.
Of course, every one&rsquo;s willing to run risks if it&rsquo;s worth
while. I&rsquo;m sure you are. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done
awfully dangerous things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy, with simple pride.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one that&rsquo;s done more for The Cause, or
run greater risks. I could tell you things&mdash;but there,
maybe I&rsquo;d better not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane clasped her hands round her knees. She
leaned back against the wall and regarded Mr. Molloy
with what he took to be admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do tell me,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;when you speak of
The Cause, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her heart of hearts Jane had a pretty firm conviction
that, to Mr. Molloy, The Cause stood for
whatever promoted the wealth, welfare, and advancement
of himself, the said Molloy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy reverentially. He spread out
his hands with a fine gesture. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what I mean,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;is this. What do
you really call yourself? You know, I always used to
call you &lsquo;The Anarchist Uncle,&rsquo; but the other day some
one said that there were no Anarchists any more,
so I wondered what you really were. Are you a
Socialist, or a Communist, or a Bolshevist, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A doubtful expression crossed Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s handsome
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would depend on the
company I was in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane had a struggle with the dimple and subdued it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;that if you were with
Socialists, you would be a Socialist; and if you were
with Bolshevists, you would be a Bolshevist?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be something like that,&rdquo; admitted
Mr. Molloy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;And, of course, whatever you
were, you&rsquo;d naturally want to be sure that it was going
to be worth your while. I mean you&rsquo;d want to get
something out of it?&rdquo; She waited a moment, and
then went on, with a complete change of voice and
manner, &ldquo;What are you going to get out of this?&rdquo;
She spoke with the utmost gravity. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
know, I can tell you. Disaster&mdash;at best a long term
of imprisonment, at the worst death, the sort of death
one doesn&rsquo;t care about having in one&rsquo;s family. The
question is, is it worth it? You&rsquo;re not in the least
mad. You&rsquo;re not a fanatic either. You are a perfectly
sane and reasonable person, and you know
that what I&rsquo;m saying is the sane and reasonable
truth. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, and wasn&rsquo;t I saying so to Ember myself,&rdquo;
said Molloy in gloomy agreement. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got money
enough, and we can live on it retired, so to speak. The
life&rsquo;s all very well when you&rsquo;re young, but a man of my
age isn&rsquo;t just so keen on taking chances as he was, and
that&rsquo;s the truth. Then there&rsquo;s the old times come over
him, and he thinks of the place where he was born, and
he thinks, maybe, he&rsquo;d like to see it again. Why,
with the money I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
fine house I could have in Galway, and a car, and a
horse or two. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane saw his face light up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine town Galway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there are
people I&rsquo;d like to see there, and places too. The
people would be changed, I&rsquo;m thinking, but not the
places. I&rsquo;d like well enough to go up the river past
Menlough again. It&rsquo;s the grand woods there are there,
and then there&rsquo;s a place where you&rsquo;d see nothing but
reeds, and no way at all for a boat. But let you push
through the reeds and a way there is, and you come
out to the grey open water and the country round it
just as bare as if you&rsquo;d taken sand-paper to it. They
used to say that the water went down to hell, but I&rsquo;m
not saying that I believe it; but deep it is, for no one&rsquo;s
ever touched the bottom. Many&rsquo;s the stone I&rsquo;ve
dropped in there, and wakened in the night to wonder
if it was still sinking; and many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve played
truant, and gone there fishing for the great pike that
they said was in it. Hundreds of years old he is by
the tales, and once I could swear I saw him, only
maybe it was only a cloud that was passing overhead.
What I saw was just a grey shadow, and all at once it
come over me that I should be getting back to my
work. I was black frightened, that&rsquo;s the truth, but I
couldn&rsquo;t tell you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked at Mr. Molloy, and experienced some
very strange sensations. He might sell her to Ember
next moment, but for this moment he was utterly
sincere and as simple as a child. His sentiments were
not hypocrisy. They represented real feeling and
emotion; but feeling, emotion, and sentiment had been
trained to take the wall obediently at the bidding of
what Mr. Molloy would call business. For all her
youth, Jane felt a rush of pity for anything so played
upon from without, so ungoverned from within as this
big handsome man who stood there talking earnestly
of his boyhood&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go back and see it all again?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; said Mr. Molloy, &ldquo;but what
good&rsquo;ll my house in Galway do me if I waken up some
fine night with a knife in me heart or a bomb gone off
under me bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed a difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>Molloy began to pace the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must think,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>All the time that Jane had been talking, part of her
mind had been continually occupied with the question
of the lists, those lists of towns and the agents in each
who were to be entrusted with the work of destruction.
It might not be so difficult to get hold of them, but
to get hold of them without their being missed by
Ember ... that was the difficulty. She had only to
drop her right hand to the bench on which she sat and
it touched the flimsy sheets.</p>
<p>Whilst Molloy was discoursing of his birthplace, she
considered more than one plan. She must not precipitate
Ember&rsquo;s suspicions until she could place this
evidence in Henry&rsquo;s hands. If she took the lists and
Ember missed them, he would suspect and accuse
Molloy, and Molloy would most certainly exonerate
himself at her expense. On the other hand, if she let
the lists slip when they were under her hand, who was
to say whether the opportunity would recur. Ember
would return. He already distrusted Molloy, and
what would be more likely than that he would remove
such incriminating papers from Molloy&rsquo;s care?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, Jane knew what she must do.
She didn&rsquo;t want to do it, but she knew she must.
She must get the papers now, she must copy them,
and she must put them back before daybreak whilst
the Anarchist Uncle was asleep. Jane had never
contemplated anything which frightened her half so
much as the idea of putting those papers back in that
discouraging hour before the dawn, but she knew that
it must be done.</p>
<p>As Mr. Molloy walked up and down frowning intently,
there were moments when his back was turned
towards Jane. The first time this happened Jane&rsquo;s
hand took hold of the thin papers and doubled them
in half. The next time that it happened she doubled
them again. She went on doubling them until the
large thin sheaf had become a small fat wad. Then
whilst Molloy&rsquo;s back was turned she lifted her skirt
and pushed the wad down inside her stocking top.
When Molloy faced her again her hands were folded
on her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really must be going,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He threw her an odd, sidelong glance. It made
Jane feel a little cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you heard so much just now, I don&rsquo;t doubt
you heard Ember tell me just how convenient this
place would be for putting some one that wasn&rsquo;t
wanted out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard what he said,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid Mr. Ember doesn&rsquo;t know everything. As far
as I remember, he described these passages as a place
no one knew anything about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Molloy, staring.</p>
<p>Jane gave a little laugh, and felt pleased with herself
because it sounded steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to my certain knowledge, three other people
know the way in here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Molloy showed signs of uneasiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you and me and ... since you heard
the rest, I&rsquo;m supposing you heard me name Number
One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean you and me at all,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;I was thinking of two quite different people, and as to
Number One, I could answer that better if I were sure
who Number One was. The third person I&rsquo;m thinking
of may be Number One, or may not. I&rsquo;m not
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said Molloy&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking you
know too much. I&rsquo;m thinking you know a deal too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane met his eyes full. Her own were steady, his
were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell Mr. Ember, and let him
&lsquo;eliminate&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy gave a violent start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you hear that?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I who heard that, it was Renata. It
was one of the things that made her so anxious to
change places with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what made you willing to change with her?&rdquo;
Molloy&rsquo;s voice was harsh with suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t a job, or any relations to go to. I had
exactly one-and-sixpence in the world. I didn&rsquo;t know
where I was going to sleep that night&mdash;that&rsquo;s pretty
awful for a girl, you know; and then ... Renata was
so frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would be,&rdquo; was Molloy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;And
weren&rsquo;t you frightened now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I was,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had need to be.&rdquo; The something that had
made Jane feel cold before was in Molloy&rsquo;s look and
voice. &ldquo;You had need to be more afraid than you&rsquo;ve
ever been in your life. Renata would have stayed
quiet, but nothing would serve you but you must
push, and poke, and pry. What were you doing here
at all now, will you tell me that? Who showed you
how to get down here? You say there are others
who know the secret&mdash;who are they? Tell me
that, will you ... who are they?&rdquo; Molloy&rsquo;s
sudden passion took Jane by surprise. Her heart
began to beat, and she had difficulty in controlling
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which question am I to answer first?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Shall I begin at the beginning? I found the
passages by accident....&rdquo; Molloy gave an impatient
snort. &ldquo;Yes, I did really, on my word of
honour. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and came down to get a
book. I was standing in the shadow and I saw some
one come out of the panelling. Next night I thought
I&rsquo;d try and find the place. The same person came
downstairs and went through the door in the wall. I
followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you know,&rdquo; said Jane, speaking
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a woman?&rdquo; said Molloy. He dropped
his voice to a whisper and looked over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>Jane nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be to God!&rdquo; said Molloy. &ldquo;Did you see
her face?&rdquo; Jane nodded again. Molloy came quite
close, bent down, and whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it the old man&rsquo;s daughter? Was it&rdquo;&mdash;his
voice dropped to the very edge of inaudibility&mdash;&ldquo;was
it Lady Heritage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane nodded for the third time.</p>
<p>Molloy spun round, went straight to the steel door,
and, opening it, looked up the passage. After a
moment he came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw her face? Will you swear that you
saw her face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve seen more than I have. Do you
know, I&rsquo;ve never been sure. I&rsquo;ve never really been
sure. Ember&rsquo;s talk, and&mdash;it was her face you saw,
not that mask thing they wear in the laboratory, for
that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve seen? You saw her face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw her face quite plainly,&rdquo; said Jane. In
her own mind something seemed to say with cold
finality, &ldquo;Then Lady Heritage is Number One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.... Well.... Well.... Well....&rdquo; said
Mr. Molloy.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. He seemed lost in thought,
but suddenly he turned on Jane with the question
which she hoped he had forgotten:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying that there were two others who
knew the secret&mdash;you saw them down here?&mdash;down
here in the passages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, without hesitation, &ldquo;I did. They
were men. One of them had a beard. I couldn&rsquo;t tell
you their names or describe them any more than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy looked desperately puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ember may know,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I should ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Molloy gave a grunt and began to walk up and down
again. The simile of the rat in the drain which he had
made use of in conversing with Ember came back upon
him with unpleasant force. His thoughts were confused
by an access of unreasoning fear. Every time
the question of what to do with Jane presented itself,
he shied away from it. Jane knew too much. There
was no doubt about that. She knew too much.</p>
<p>In the circles frequented by Mr. Molloy self-preservation
dictated a certain course with regard to the person
who knew too much. After thirty years Molloy
still disliked the contemplation of that course of action.
He was of those who pass by upon the other side. He
had a well-cultivated faculty for looking the other way.
It occurred to him that, after all, Jane was Ember&rsquo;s
affair. Let her go back to the house, she was Ember&rsquo;s
affair, not his. He became instantly very anxious to
see the last of Jane.</p>
<p>Just as she was wondering how long this rather
horrid silence was going to last, he walked up to her
in a purposeful manner, put his hand on her arm, and
pulled her to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best be getting back,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>Jane felt as if some one had lifted a heavy weight off
the top of her head. The weight must have been
fear, and yet she did not know that she had been
afraid.</p>
<p>At the gate Molloy turned to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get into the hall?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Without
being seen, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, it&rsquo;s awfully risky. But I could walk
home from the headland, that would be much safer,
and if I&rsquo;ve been missed, it would account for my
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Molloy bent a sulky look on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The headland&mdash;you know that too?&rdquo; he said.
Then, with an impatient jerk he switched off the light,
turned on his torch, and walked ahead of Jane in
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span></h2>
<p>Never in all her life had Jane seen anything so
beautiful as the clear rain-washed sky, the grey
rain-stilled sea. The little thud of the stone closing
between her and Mr. Molloy was one of the most
delightful sounds that she had ever heard. She felt
as if she had never really appreciated the daylight
before. There were nice woolly clouds on the horizon.
The damp air was fresh, not like the air in those abominable
passages. There was a gorse bush with about
two and a half yellow flowers on it, rather sodden with
the rain. Jane regarded them with intense affection.</p>
<p>She walked down the gravel path, drawing long
breaths and ready to sing with pure relief&mdash;&ldquo;Ease after
toyle, port after stormie seas.&rdquo; She frowned, remembering
the next line. After all, they were not out of
the wood yet. An unpleasant proverb succeeded
Spenser&rsquo;s line&mdash;&ldquo;He laughs longest who laughs last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; said Jane out loud, and she began to
run.</p>
<p>She came in with such a glowing colour that Mr.
Ember, who met her in the hall, was moved to remark
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have enjoyed your walk. Where
have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round by the headland,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>The roll of typed paper pricked her knee beneath
her stocking top. In her arms she carried a sheaf of
yellow tulips. She made haste to her room and set
the flowers in a jar on the broad window ledge where
they could be plainly seen from the terrace. With all
her heart she prayed that George Patterson, who was
Anthony Luttrell, would see them. She did not know
that George Patterson had ceased to exist, and that
Anthony Luttrell, having taken the law into his own
impatient hands, was on his way to London.</p>
<p>There had been an encounter with Raymond in the
laboratory&mdash;her hand for a moment on his arm, his
muscles rigid under her touch; not a word spoken on
either side, not a word needed. The scene carried
Anthony to his breaking-point. At the next roll-call
George Patterson was missing. Meanwhile Raymond
was behind a locked door, and Jane set yellow tulips
on her window-sill.</p>
<p>Having made her signal, Jane turned her mind to
the lists. She was afraid to keep them on her, and she
was afraid to hide them anywhere else. If Molloy
missed them, and had any means of communicating
with Ember, she would be searched, and her room
would be searched. Whatever happened to her, they
must not recover the lists until she had copied
them.</p>
<p>She remembered the trap-door in the cupboard,
but it was just possible that Ember knew about it,
not likely but possible. After five minutes&rsquo; profound
thought, she went to a drawer into which she had
emptied a quantity of odds and ends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>Renata, it appeared, had a mild taste for drawing.
There were pencils, indiarubber, a roll of cartridge
paper, and some drawing-pins. Jane took out the
cartridge paper and the drawing-pins. She extracted
the lists from her stocking top and smoothed them out
flat. Then she opened the cupboard door, mounted
on a chair drawn as close to the cupboard as possible,
and pinned the lists on to the cupboard ceiling with
a sheet of cartridge paper covering them. They just
fitted in between two rows of hooks. Jane got down
with a sigh of relief and unlocked her bedroom door.</p>
<p>The evening passed like a dream. Lady Heritage
did not appear at all, and Jane found a strange unreality
in the situation which kept her talking to Mr.
Ember in set schoolgirl phrases whilst he condescended
to her with more than a hint of sarcasm. She was
glad when she could take a book and read.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock before she dared begin her
night&rsquo;s work, but she came up to her room with her
plan all ready. First she took off her dress and put
on a dressing-gown, just in case any one should come
to the door. Then, having turned the key and switched
off the light, she took a candle into the cupboard, set
it on a shoe box, and took down the lists. She put
a cushion on the floor, fetched Renata&rsquo;s fountain pen
and some sheets of foolscap which she had taken from
the library, and began her work of copying. With
the cupboard door shut there was no chance that
any one would see her candle.</p>
<p>She wrote steadily, town after town, name after
name. More towns, more names. As she finished
each sheet, she checked it very carefully by its original.
It was weary, monotonous work; but the weariness
and the monotony were like a grey curtain which
hung between her and something which she dreaded
inexpressibly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The idea of descending into the passage again, of
creeping up to the laboratory in order to put back the
lists before they were missed, filled her with shuddering
repugnance. To allow her mind to dwell upon this
idea was to become incapable of carrying it out.
She therefore held her attention firmly to the endless
names, and drove an industrious pen. She had to
get up twice for more ink. Each time, as she stretched
herself and walked the few paces to the table and back,
the thought came to her like a cold breath, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
coming nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, in the dead stillness of the sleeping hours,
the lists were finished. She pinned the copies on to
the cupboard ceiling in the same way that she had
pinned the originals, carefully covered with a piece of
cartridge paper. Then she took the originals in her
hand and faced the necessity for action. Her feet and
hands were very cold. She felt as if it were days
since she had had anything to eat. She wanted most
dreadfully to go to bed and sleep. She wanted to
have a good cry. What she had to do was to go down
into slug- and possibly rat-haunted passages and risk
waking an Anarchist Uncle out of his beauty sleep.
Jane gave herself a mental shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a rabbit, Jane Smith,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
got to be done. You know that just as well as I do.
If it&rsquo;s got to be done, you can do it. Get going at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>She got going. First she put the lists back in her
stocking top. Then she put on the old serge dress.
Her fancy played hopefully with the thought that
some day she would give herself the pleasure of burning
that abominable garment. She extracted the maroon
felt slippers from the paper parcel to which she had
consigned them. They were still sopping. She put
them on. They felt limp, damp, and discouraging,
but they had the merit of making no noise. Then
she took a good length of candle and a box of matches
and opened her door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; said Jane, and stepped into
pitch darkness. This time she shut the door behind
her. As she took her hand off the handle she felt
as if she were letting go of her last hold on safety, an
idiotic thought, as she instantly told herself. She
knew by now just how many paces took one to the
place where the light should have been burning, and
just how many more to the stairhead. The rose
window showed like a pattern painted on the dark.
It gave no light, but it marked the position of the door.</p>
<p>Jane felt the soles of her feet stick and cling to the
damp slippers as she crawled down the stairs. They
just didn&rsquo;t squelch and that was all; they only felt
like it.</p>
<p>She hated moving the big chair in the dark, but it
had to be done. Suppose she dropped it with a crash,
suppose she pulled Willoughby Luttrell&rsquo;s picture down
when she was feeling for the catch; suppose a mouse
ran over her foot&mdash;there is no end to the cheerful
suppositions which will throng one&rsquo;s brain in circumstances
like these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Jane did not drop the chair with a crash, neither
did Willoughby Luttrell&rsquo;s picture fall down, nor did
a mouse run over her foot. She passed through the
panelled door, shut it behind her, groped her way to
the foot of the steps, and lighted the candle. It was
then that the cheering thought that she might perhaps
encounter Henry came to her, only to fade as she remembered
how long past midnight it now was. However,
if she had not Henry she had at least a light.
It is much harder to be brave in the pitch dark even
when, as in the present case, the darkness is really
a protection.</p>
<p>Jane walked quite blithely up the second passage on
the left until she came to the point where she knew
that she must put the light out again. Molloy might
be awake. She blew out her candle and began to
feel her way forward. She came to the corner, and
passed it. Moving very slowly and cautiously, she
crept up to the steel gate and stood with her fingertips
on it, listening, and thinking hard. She could feel
that the door was ajar. That struck her as strange,
very strange. If there ever was a man badly scared,
Molloy was that man when she had said that the secret
of the passages was not confined to himself and Ember.
Yet he had gone to sleep leaving the gate ajar. Had
he? Jane&rsquo;s mind gave her a clear and definite answer.
He hadn&rsquo;t, he wouldn&rsquo;t. She had been so sure that
the gate would be shut, so ready with her plan. She
was going to unfold the papers, push them between
the bars, and jerk them as far across the room as
possible. Molloy might think they had fallen from
the bench, or, if he had his doubts, might well wish
to avoid letting Ember know that Jane had been in the
laboratory. All this she had so present in her thought,
that to feel the gate give to her hand staggered her
and set her shaking. She quieted herself and listened
intently. Not a sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>She did not somehow fancy that Molloy would be a
quiet sleeper. She had anticipated snores of a certain
rich bass quality. Here was silence in which one
might have heard an infant draw its breath, a silence
undisturbed, inviolate.</p>
<p>It was not only the silence which spoke to Jane.
That odd, dim, only half-understood sense which some
people possess, clamoured to her that the place was
empty. As she stood there, and the seconds dragged
into minutes, this sense became so insistent that she
found herself resolving to act in obedience to its
dictates.</p>
<p>She pushed the gate and heard the alarm ring.
With all her ears she listened for the sound of a man
stirring, waking, and starting up. At the first movement
she would have been away, and Molloy, new
roused from sleep, would never have caught sight of
her. There was no movement. The bell went on
ringing, a little continuous trickle of metallic sound,
not loud but as confusing as the buzzing of a mosquito.</p>
<p>Jane switched on the light, slipped round the gate,
and closed it. The bell stopped ringing. The jarred
silence settled slowly, as dust settles when it has been
stirred. There was no one there. The unshaded light
showed every corner of the chamber. Molloy&rsquo;s bag
was gone. Like a flick in the face came certainty.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone. Molloy&rsquo;s gone too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, almost mechanically, Jane extracted the
rolled-up lists from her stocking. She was still holding
the unlighted candle in her left hand. The lists
bothered her. She moved towards the bench to put
them down, but first she laid the candle carefully on
its side so as not to stub the wick, and, sitting down,
began to smooth the papers out upon her knee. It
was whilst she was doing this that she saw the note.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>It lay on the end of the bench propped up against
a book. It was addressed to Jeffrey Ember, Esquire.
The capital E&rsquo;s were magnificent flourishes; an underlining
like an ornamental scroll supported the superscription.
Jane, like other well-brought-up people,
was not in the habit of opening letters not addressed
to herself. It may be said, however, that no solitary
scruple so much as raised its head on this occasion.
She tore open the tough linen envelope, and unfolded
a lordly sheet. Molloy wrote a good, bold hand and
legible withal. Every word stood clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My dear Ember</span>,&mdash;I&rsquo;m off. The place is getting
altogether too crowded. I&rsquo;ve seen Renata, and she
tells me that there are two men use the passages. One
has a beard, but she couldn&rsquo;t tell me their names or
describe them further. She knows all about the
passages herself. She confessed to having found them
through following Number One. She has also seen
you come in and go out. I don&rsquo;t think this place is
very healthy, so I&rsquo;m making my get-away whilst I
can. Drop the whole thing and get out quick is what
I advise. I&rsquo;m staunch, as you&rsquo;ll find. Why did
you take the lists after saying you&rsquo;d leave them for
me to look through? I&rsquo;ll not work with a man that
doesn&rsquo;t trust me. You can write me at the old
place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter was signed with a large Roman three.
It appeared that Mr. Molloy was more careful over his
own identity than over that of Mr. Jeffrey Ember.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Jane sat looking at the letter. It made her feel
rather sick. If she had not come down, if she had
shirked putting the papers back, if the letter addressed
to Jeffrey Ember, Esquire, had reached Jeffrey Ember&rsquo;s
hands&mdash;well, it was a good enough death-warrant,
and Molloy must have known that very well when he
wrote it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly like a Moral Tract,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I
hated coming back, and I did it from a Sense of Duty,
and this is the Reward of Virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the Reward of Virtue down rather gingerly
on the bench beside her. She felt about touching it
rather as she had felt when she touched the slug. She
wanted to wash her hands. An odd creature Molloy.
He had given her away exactly and completely, yet he
had left her any small shred of protection which she
might be supposed to derive from passing as his
daughter.</p>
<p>Jane turned her thoughts from Molloy to the more
pressing consideration of her own immediate course of
action. Ember would come in the morning, and would
find Molloy gone, and no word to say where he had
gone, or why. The idea of following in Molloy&rsquo;s footsteps
presented itself vividly before Jane&rsquo;s imagination.
Why should she stay any longer at Luttrell Marches?
The idea of getting away set her heart dancing. And
what was there to stay for? She had all the evidence
necessary to procure Ember&rsquo;s arrest and the smashing
of the conspiracy. The sooner she was out of Luttrell
Marches and with her precious papers in a place of
security the better. For a moment she contemplated
taking the originals of the lists; Ember would naturally
conclude that it was Molloy who had gone off with
them. But on second thoughts she decided that it
would be in the highest degree unwise to put Ember
on his guard. His distrust of Molloy might be so
great as to induce flight. She decided to leave the
originals and to take the copies&mdash;but she had left the
copies in her room pinned to the cupboard ceiling.
Go back for them she could not. Even if she could
have forced herself to the effort, the risk was too great.
They must stay where they were, whilst she found
Henry. The sooner she got off the better. She had
no watch, but the night must be very far spent, and
if Ember were to take it into his head to come back&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>The bare idea brought Jane to her feet. She picked
up her candle, lit it, and with feelings of extreme
satisfaction set fire to Molloy&rsquo;s letter, making a little
pent roof of it like the beginning of a card house on the
stone floor. She had often admired the way in which
masses of compromising documents are consumed in
an instant by the hero or heroine of the adventure
novel. She used four matches before she considered
that this particular letter was really harmless. The
envelope took two more. Then she collected the ash
very carefully, crumbled it up well, and scattered it
amongst the rubble in the broken-down passage where
Molloy had found her. Then, having taken a good look
round to make sure that nothing compromising remained,
she picked up her candle and passed through
the gate, leaving the laboratory in darkness behind her.
When she came to the turn she hesitated, and finally
went straight on, following the passage which she had
not yet explored, down which Molloy and Ember had
come the day before. She was almost sure that it
would lead back into the main corridor just short of the
headland exit; but she had not gone more than a yard
or two along it when she heard something that brought
her heart into her mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Almost as the sound reached her she had blown her
candle out and was pinching the glow from the wick.
For a moment the darkness was full of phantom
tongue-shaped flames; then she stopped seeing them
and saw instead a faint glow coming from the direction
in which she herself had come on her way to the
laboratory. Somebody was coming along the passage.
If she had gone back by the same way that she had
come, she would have met this somebody. As it was,
she might escape notice. If the person were going to
the laboratory, he would have to take a sharp turn
to the left, a right-angled turn. The passage in
which she was ran off at an acute angle, and the person
approaching would have his back to her as he
passed.</p>
<p>The glow became a beam. Next moment Ember
passed without turning his head. Jane saw the back
of his shoulder dark against the light from his torch,
and caught a fleeting glimpse of his profile, just enough
for recognition and no more. Indeed, it was the fur
coat that she recognised as much as the man. She
stood quite still whilst he switched on the electric light
and passed into the laboratory, then she turned and
walked away as quickly as she dared, feeling her way
by the wall till a turn in the passage gave her enough
courage to light her candle. She put the spent match
in her pocket, looked ahead, and drew a sharp, almost
agonised, breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>About two feet from where she stood, and exactly
in her path, was the black mouth of an uncovered well.
Jane looked at it, and quite suddenly, she had no idea
how, found herself sitting on the floor with hot wax
running down her hand from the guttering candle. It
seemed to be quite a little time before she could make
sure of walking steadily enough to skirt the well. She
went by it at last with averted head and fingers that,
regardless of slime, clung to the wall.</p>
<p>As she had expected, the passage ran suddenly into
the main corridor. She passed the headland exit, and
once more was on unknown ground. The passage
swung round to the right and began to slope downhill.
Jane held her candle high and looked at every step;
but there were no more traps. She quickened her pace
almost to a run as the dreadful thought came to her
that Ember might follow Molloy. The passage sloped
more and more. Finally there were steps, smooth,
worn, and damp, that went down, and down, and down.
At the bottom of the steps a yard or two of peculiarly
slimy passage, and then a blank stone wall. Obviously
Jane had arrived.</p>
<p>She looked at the stone wall, and the stone wall
presented a front of uncompromising blankness. She
looked up and she looked down, she looked to the left
and she looked to the right, she gazed at the ceiling and
she gazed at the floor. Nowhere was there any sign of
a catch, a knob, a spring, or a lever. There must be
one, but where was it? She tapped the wall and
stamped on the floor, but with no result. The door in
the panelling opened from inside with an ordinary
handle. She had not been close enough to Lady Heritage
to see what she did to pivot the stone behind the
bench on the headland. In any case, this exit might
have been quite differently planned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>A most dreadful sense of discouragement came over
her. To have got so far, to have been, as it were, halfway
to safety and Henry, and to have to turn back
again! Then for the first time it occurred to her that,
even if she had got out and got away, she had no money
and no hat. She looked down at the maroon slippers,
and pictured herself descending ticketless upon a
London platform in bedroom slippers whose original
colour was almost obscured by green slime.</p>
<p>Jane wanted to laugh, and she wanted to cry. She
did not know which she wanted most, but presently
she found that the tears were running down her face.
She kept winking them away, because it is not at all
easy to climb slippery stone steps by the light of a
guttering candle if your eyes keep filling with tears.
The tears magnified the candle flame, and sometimes
made it look like two or three little flames, which was
dreadfully confusing. Jane stood still, wiped her eyes
with determined energy, and then climbed up more
steps and back along the way that she had come.</p>
<p>At the headland exit she stood still, taking breath
and thought. Nothing would induce her to pass that
well again. She would keep to the main passage, and,
horrid thought, she would have to put out her light in
case Ember should suddenly emerge from the side
passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking about things makes them worse, not
better,&rdquo; said Jane to herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly beastly;
but then it&rsquo;s all perfectly beastly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blew out the candle and moved slowly forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>It seemed ages before she came past the opening
where she had run into Henry to the foot of the steps.
She went up three steps, raised her foot to take the
fourth, and felt a hardly perceptible check. Instantly
she drew back a shade, set her foot down beside the
other, and put out a tentative, groping hand. There
was a thread of cotton stretched from wall to wall at
the level of her waist. If her movements had been less
gentle she would have brushed through it without
noticing. Then, as she stood there thinking, the thread
between her fingers, something else came to her. The
last yard of passage just at the stair foot had felt
different&mdash;dry, gritty.</p>
<p>Jane descended the three steps backwards, and,
crouching on the bottom one, put down her hand and
felt the floor of the passage. There was sand on it, dry
sand which had not been there when she came down,
and in the dry sand her footprints would be clearly
marked. Obviously Mr. Ember had his suspicions and
his methods of verifying them: &ldquo;Though what on
earth he&rsquo;d make of cork soles I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said
Jane. She decided not to worry him with this
problem.</p>
<p>It was horribly dangerous, but she must have a
light. She set her candle end on the step above
her and struck a match. It made a noise like a
squib and went out. She struck another and got the
candle lighted.</p>
<p>The sand was yellow sand off the beach, but nice and
dry. Two and a half of her footprints showed plainly
on its smooth surface. Jane leaned forward and
smoothed them out. Then she blew out her candle and
felt safer. Feeling for the thread of cotton, she crawled
beneath it, then very, very slowly up the rest of the
steps, her hand before her all the way till she came to
the door in the panelling. She opened it and slipped
through into the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>The grey, uncertain light was filtering into it. Everything
looked strange and cold. Jane closed the door,
and never knew that a loose strand of cotton had fallen
as she passed. Neither did she know that at that
very moment Jeffrey Ember was standing by the open
well mouth, the ray from his powerful electric torch
focused upon a little patch of candle grease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span></h2>
<p>Anthony Luttrell caught a slow local train
at Withstead&mdash;the sort of train that serves little
country places all over England. It dawdled slowly
from station to station, sometimes taking what
appeared to be an unnecessary rest at a signal box as
well. It finally reached Maxton ten minutes late,
thereby missing the London express and leaving
Anthony Luttrell with a two hours&rsquo; wait.</p>
<p>Waiting just at present was about as congenial an
occupation as being racked. He walked up and down
with a dragging, restless step, and tried unsuccessfully
to shut off his torturing thoughts behind a safety
curtain. The time dragged intolerably. Presently he
left the platform and went up on to the bridge which
ran from one side of the station to the other. Here he
began his pacing again, stopping every now and then
to watch a train come in or a train go out. From the
bridge one could see all the platforms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>When an express rushed through, the whole structure
shook and clouds of white steam blotted out everything.
It was when the steam was clearing away,
and the roar of the receding train was dying down,
that Anthony noticed another local running in to the
Withstead platform. He bent over the rail and
watched the passengers get out&mdash;just a handful. There
was a young woman with two children, two farmers,
three or four nondescript women, and a big man with a
suit-case. Anthony looked at the big man and went
on looking at him. Something about him seemed
vaguely familiar. The man came along the platform
and began to mount the steps that led up to the bridge.
Half-way up he put down his suit-case, took off his
hat for a moment as if to cool himself, and stood
there looking up. Then he replaced his hat, shifted
the suit-case to the other hand, and came up the rest
of the steps. He seemed hot.</p>
<p>He passed Anthony and went down the steps on to
the London platform. Anthony followed him.</p>
<p>When the big man stood still and looked up, eight
years were suddenly wiped out. Memory is a queer
thing, and plays queer tricks. What Anthony&rsquo;s
memory did was to set him down in the year 1912, in
the gallery of a hall in Chicago. There was a packed
and rather vociferous audience. There was a big man
on the platform, a big man who seemed hot. His
speech was, in fact, of a sufficiently inflammatory
nature to make any one feel hot. It breathed fire and
fury. Its rolling eloquence must have involved a
good deal of physical exertion. Suddenly, after a
period, the speaker stopped and looked up at the
gallery for applause. It came like a veritable cyclone.
The meeting was subsequently broken up by the
police.</p>
<p>Anthony remembered that the speaker&rsquo;s name was
Molloy. If Mr. Molloy had come from Withstead,
it occurred to Anthony that his destination would
probably be of interest.</p>
<p>The London train was due in ten minutes. When it
came in, Molloy got into a third-class carriage, and
Anthony followed his example.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>It was at seven-thirty on Sunday morning that Mrs.
March&rsquo;s cook, who was sweeping the hall, was given
what she afterwards described as a turn by the arrival
of an odd-looking man who would give no name and
insisted on seeing her master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful he looked with that &rsquo;orrid scar and his &rsquo;air
that wild, and not giving me a chance to shut the door
in his face, for he pushes in the moment I got it open&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what give me the worst turn of all&mdash;and walks
into the dining-room as bold as brass, and says, &lsquo;I
want to see Captain March&mdash;and be quick, please.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Henry came into the dining-room he shut the
door behind him very quickly and looked as if he also
had had a turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Tony, what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Anthony, with nonchalance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then in Heaven&rsquo;s name, why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m through, that&rsquo;s all. You can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t
give notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of what I say, it&rsquo;s what Piggy&rsquo;ll
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got a sop for Piggy. I&rsquo;ve been doing the
faithful sleuth. I&rsquo;ve trailed a man from Withstead
to a highly genteel boarding-house in South Kensington;
and as I last saw the gentleman addressing an
I. W. W. meeting in Chicago, I imagine Piggy might
be interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; said Henry quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good man. You&rsquo;re in luck. Molloy, under the
interesting <i>alias</i> of Bernier, has just been selling the
Government Formula &lsquo;A.&rsquo; He was trailed over here
with the swag and then lost sight of. For a dead cert
he&rsquo;s been to Luttrell Marches by the back way and
seen Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the devil to pay down there,&rdquo; he said....
&ldquo;No, no, the girl&rsquo;s all right.... This is something
I ought to have told you when you were down. I ought
to have told you the whole thing. I couldn&rsquo;t bring
myself to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Tony. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo; He walked to the window and
stood there, looking out. His hands made restless
movements. He spoke, keeping his back to Henry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go through all the passages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was going to to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have told you. The big place under
the terrace, you know&mdash;they&rsquo;ve turned it into a laboratory.
Molloy may have been working there, for all I
know; he had the name of an expert chemist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have found it yourself to-night, but I
couldn&rsquo;t let you go blundering in unwarned. Ember
might be there&mdash;any one might be there. It&rsquo;s damnable,
Henry, but I believe she&rsquo;s up to her neck in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was silent. There seemed to be nothing to
say. He also believed that Raymond Heritage was
up to her neck in whatever secret enterprise was being
developed at Luttrell Marches. He remembered the
passion in her voice when she said, &ldquo;I should like to
smash it all,&rdquo; and he remembered how she had sung,
&ldquo;Would we not shatter it to bits, and then re-mould
it nearer to the heart&rsquo;s desire?&rdquo; Whatever the thing
was, he believed she was in it up to her neck. So he
was silent, and Anthony was grateful for his silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>The silence was broken by a tapping, and a rustling,
and the turning of a handle. The door opened very
abruptly, and Mrs. de Luttrelle March made a precipitous
entrance. She wore a pink silk <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i> and
a boudoir cap embroidered in forget-me-nots, also an
expression of extreme terror&mdash;the cook&rsquo;s description
of their early visitor having prepared her to find
Henry&rsquo;s corpse stretched upon the hearth-rug. When
a living and annoyed Henry confronted her, she clung
to his arm and gazed round-eyed at the long, thin
man who had swung round at her entrance. Uncertainty
succeeded fear. Henry was saying, &ldquo;Do
go back to your room, Mother,&rdquo; but it is doubtful
whether she heard him.</p>
<p>Gradually her grasp of his arm relaxed. She walked
slowly across the room, and stared with horrified
amazement at Anthony.</p>
<p>He looked over her head at Henry, shrugged his
shoulders just perceptibly, and made as if to turn
back to the window again. Either that shrug, or the
faintly sarcastic lift of the eyebrows that accompanied
it, brought a sort of broken gasp to Mrs. March&rsquo;s lips.
She put out her hand, touched his coat sleeve with her
finger-tips, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony&mdash;it&rsquo;s Anthony&mdash;oh, Henry, it&rsquo;s Anthony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She backed a little at each repetition of the name,
looked wildly round, and sinking on to the nearest
chair, burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry&mdash;oh, please somebody speak,&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Aunt Rosa. I&rsquo;m not a ghost,&rdquo; said
Anthony in his driest voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>Henry experienced a cold dread of what his mother
would say next. She had talked so much and thought
so incessantly of Luttrell Marches. Latterly she had
been so sure of Henry&rsquo;s ownership, and so proud of it.
What would she say now&mdash;as she dropped her hands
from her face and gazed with streaming eyes at
Anthony, who regarded her quizzically?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, you&rsquo;re so dreadfully changed. That fearful
scar&mdash;oh, my dear, where have you been all this time?
We thought you were dead. I don&rsquo;t know how I
recognised you. And you were <i>such</i> a pretty little
boy, my dear. I used to be jealous because you had
longer eyelashes than Henry, but you haven&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Anthony, with perfect gravity.
He took his aunt&rsquo;s plump white hand and gave it a
squeeze and a pat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of you to welcome
me, Aunt Rosa. The scar isn&rsquo;t as bad as it looks, and
Henry&rsquo;s going to lend me a razor and some clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was later, when Anthony could be heard splashing
in the bathroom, that Mrs. March beckoned Henry
into her room, flung her arms round his neck, and
burst into tears all over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so hard on you&mdash;about
Luttrell Marches, I mean&mdash;do you mind
dreadfully?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an atom. Besides, I knew Tony was alive;
I always told you he would turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of any one but him at first,&rdquo; said
Mrs. March, sniffing gently. &ldquo;Then afterwards it
came over me Henry won&rsquo;t have the place&mdash;and I
couldn&rsquo;t help crying because, of course, one does get
to count on a thing, with every one saying to me as they
did, &lsquo;<i>Of course</i> your son comes into Luttrell Marches,
such a beautiful place,&rsquo;&mdash;and so it is, and I did think
it was yours, and what I felt about it was, if I feel badly
about it, what must Henry feel? You see, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry endeavoured to disengage himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, but you needn&rsquo;t worry&mdash;you really
needn&rsquo;t. Look here, you dress and don&rsquo;t cry any more.
I&rsquo;ve got to telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. March clasped her hands about his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, wait, just a minute,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
Miss Smith&mdash;you&rsquo;re not still thinking about her, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. March. She fidgeted with
Henry&rsquo;s coat sleeve, bridled a little, and looked down
at her mauve satin slippers. &ldquo;Well&mdash;you know, my dear
boy, I didn&rsquo;t want to be <i>unkind</i>, but I simply couldn&rsquo;t
picture her at Luttrell Marches&mdash;as its mistress, I
mean&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure you did think me unkind about
it; but now that it&rsquo;s all different&mdash;Tony coming back
like this does make a difference, of course, and what I
was going to say about it is this. If you really do care
for her and it would make up to you for the disappointment,
I wouldn&rsquo;t hold out about it, not if you really
wanted it, my dear, and really cared for her, only of
course you&rsquo;d have to be quite sure, because once you&rsquo;re
married you&rsquo;re married, and there&rsquo;s no way out of it
except divorce, and, whether it&rsquo;s the fashion now or not,
I always have said and always will say, that it&rsquo;s not respectable,
it really isn&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s not a thing we&rsquo;ve ever
had in our family&mdash;not on either side,&rdquo; added Mrs.
March thoughtfully, after a slight pause for breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really do care for her, and I really am sure,&rdquo; said
Henry. He kissed his mother affectionately, and once
more attempted to detach himself from her hold.</p>
<p>Mrs. March let go with one hand in order to dab her
eyes with a scrap of pink-and-white chiffon. Then she
looked up at her son fondly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyelashes are <i>much</i> the longest,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Henry made an abrupt departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy&rsquo;ll see you as soon as you can get there,&rdquo; he
told Anthony five minutes later&mdash;&ldquo;at his house. I&rsquo;m
off to Luttrell Marches. I was going down anyhow
to-night, but, things being as they are, I think I&rsquo;ll get
a move on. Piggy&rsquo;s sending some one to the address
you gave, to keep an eye on Molloy. He doesn&rsquo;t want
him arrested yet, as he&rsquo;s in hopes that Belcovitch will
roll up&mdash;that&rsquo;s the other man concerned in the actual
sale of the formula. He went to Vienna, but was in
Paris yesterday. Good Lord, Tony, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve
got rid of that beastly beard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span></h2>
<p>Sir Julian Le Mesurier&rsquo;s study was an
extremely pleasant room, friendly with books,
and comforted by admirable chairs.</p>
<p>A Sabbath peace reigned outside in the deserted
street. Within there was no peace at all. A crocodile
hunt was in progress. Piggy, as a large and very fierce
crocodile, was performing a feat described by himself
as &ldquo;trailing his sinuous length&rdquo; across the floor, his
objective a Persian carpet island upon which a small
fat girl of three in a fluffy Sunday dress was lifting
first one plump foot and then the other, whilst at
regular intervals she uttered small but piercing screams.
Upon the crocodile&rsquo;s back sat a thin, determined little
boy of six who battered continuously upon the crocodile&rsquo;s
ribs with the heels of a new pair of boots, whilst
he shouted his defiance at the foe. At the far end of the
room sat Lady Le Mesurier with a book. At intervals
she looked up from it to say helplessly, &ldquo;Piggy, it&rsquo;s
Sunday&rdquo;&mdash;or &ldquo;Baby&rsquo;s got a new frock on, and I
expect nurse will give notice if you tear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tear,&rdquo; said the fat little girl, patting her skirts.
Then she shrieked, for the crocodile made a sudden
snap at the nearest ankle.</p>
<p>Upon this scene the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Luttrell,&rdquo; said an expressionless voice, and
Anthony entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Lady Le Mesurier gathered her baby and her book,
the crocodile unseated the small boy and arose, dusting
its trousers. A well-trained family vanished, and Sir
Julian shook hands and waved his visitor to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up to report?&rdquo; said Piggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not primarily,&rdquo; began Anthony, but was cut short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You followed Molloy. Yes, I think I prefer to have
it that way, if you don&rsquo;t mind. You followed Molloy
to this South Kensington address. How do you know
he&rsquo;s stopping there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the servant who was cleaning the knocker
whether they had a room, and she said, &lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;that
the gentleman who had just come in made them quite
full up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve sent a man to watch the place. Now,
what have you to report from Luttrell Marches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony looked straight over Sir Julian&rsquo;s shoulder
with a hard, level gaze, and spoke in a hard, forced
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a number of secret passages and chambers
under the house at Luttrell Marches. One of the
passages has an exit outside the grounds on the seashore
about a mile and a half from Withstead. The
secret has been very carefully preserved until now.
Each successive owner told his heir. No one else was
supposed to know. My father told me. When he
thought that I was dead, he also told my cousin,
Henry March. Until I went to Luttrell Marches the
other day I had no idea that any one else had discovered
the secret. I have to report that the passages have
not only been discovered, but made use of in a way
which points to something of an illegal nature. One of
the chambers is a fair-sized one: it has been turned into
a laboratory&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any sign that it has been used as such?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every sign. Power has been diverted from the
dynamos which were installed for the Government
experiments and the passages have been wired, and
some of the chambers fitted with electric light. The
whole thing has been going on under Sir William&rsquo;s very
nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve had him here to see me&mdash;terribly gone to
pieces, quite past his job, also very much annoyed with
me for having sent Henry down. Now the question
is, who&rsquo;s been wiring the passages and using the
laboratory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ember; there&rsquo;s no doubt about that, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sale of the formula? Ember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have proof. No earthly good my being sure,
or your being sure, or Henry&rsquo;s being sure. We&rsquo;ve got
to have something so solid that, after Sir Dash Blank,
K.C., has done his best to tear it into shreds, what&rsquo;s
left of it will convince a jury. Now who else is in it
besides Ember and Molloy? In the household, I
mean, down there at Luttrell Marches? Any one
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony continued to look over Sir Julian&rsquo;s shoulder.
He remained silent. Piggy got up and walked to
his writing-table. When he reached it he swung round,
and asked again sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one else, Luttrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was still silence. Then Piggy said dryly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it that there is somebody else involved. I
don&rsquo;t wish to cross-examine you, but I must know one
thing. Is it suspicion, moral certainty, or proof?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Moral certainty,&rdquo; said Anthony Luttrell. He
passed his tongue across his dry lips. Piggy did not
look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it seems to me that
Luttrell Marches is about to be the centre of some
unpleasant happenings. I think, I rather think, it
would be advisable to induce any ladies who may be
there to leave the place. Lady Heritage is there, is
she not, and er, er, Miss...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Molloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Miss&mdash;er, Molloy. Now I consider that
these two ladies should leave at once. When I say
at once I mean to-day. I should like you to go
down&mdash;by car, of course, there won&rsquo;t be any Sunday
trains&mdash;and er, fetch them away, using such inducements
and persuasions as you may think expedient.
Only they must leave. You understand, they must
leave to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony rose stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I must decline the
responsibility. The reasons which made me leave
Luttrell Marches make it impossible for me to return
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Piggy. He picked up a piece of indiarubber,
and occupied himself for about a minute and a
half in endeavouring to balance it upon the edge of a
handsome brass inkstand with an inscription on it.
When the indiarubber fell into the ink with a splash
he fished it out, using a pen with a sharp nib as a gaff,
dried it carefully on a new sheet of white blotting-paper,
and turned again to Anthony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like just to put a hypothetical case to you,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Government puts a certain very important
and confidential piece of work into the hands of an
eminent man, a man of European reputation and
unblemished probity. Evidence comes to hand of
things entirely incompatible with the secrecy and
other conditions which were an honourable obligation.
Worse suspicions of illegality and conspiracy. Cumulative
evidence. Arrests. A public trial. Now, my
dear Luttrell, can you tell me what would happen
to the Government which had displayed such incompetence
as, first, to commit a vital undertaking to a
person capable of betraying it; and second, of permitting
the consequent scandal to become public
property in such a manner as to make this country a
laughing-stock in the eyes of the world? It&rsquo;s not a
question that requires a great deal of answering,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William is not involved,&rdquo; said Anthony harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Luttrell, I was putting a hypothetical
case. But if you wish to talk without camouflage
I will do so&mdash;for five minutes. I will do so because I
consider that the situation is one of the most serious
which I have ever had to deal with. Sir William is not
involved, but Sir William has become incompetent
to control his household and incapable of perceiving
that a dangerous conspiracy is being carried on under
his roof. It&rsquo;s not only the matter of the stolen formula.
Your report of a hidden laboratory certainly tends to
corroborate the very grave allegations made by Miss
Molloy. A situation so entirely serious justifies me
in demanding the sacrifice of your personal feelings
and inclinations. I repeat, Lady Heritage and Miss
Molloy must leave Luttrell Marches to-day. I don&rsquo;t
care what inducements you use. They must leave.
I believe you can get them to leave. I don&rsquo;t believe
any one else can. I am detaining Sir William in town&mdash;it
was not difficult to do so. What more natural
than that his daughter should join him. My wife is
expecting Miss Smith to pay us a visit. There must
be no delay of any kind. You understand, Luttrell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>There was a short tense pause.</p>
<p>Anthony stood as he had been standing during all
the time that Sir Julian talked. He looked moodily
out of the window. Now and then his face twitched,
now and then he moved his hands with a sort of jerk.
At last he said in a constrained voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Piggy briskly. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d
better be off. From the fact that you have shaved and
returned to civilised raiment, I imagine that George
Patterson is now obsolete, and that Mr. Luttrell has
ceased to be a corpse in some unknown grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo; A pause&mdash;then, &ldquo;Sir
Julian&mdash;this&mdash;this duty is particularly unwelcome. If
I undertake it, will you send me abroad again as soon
as possible? England is distasteful, impossible&mdash;but,
of course, I realise that I couldn&rsquo;t go on being dead&mdash;there
are too many legal complications, and it wasn&rsquo;t
fair on Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; observed Piggy, &ldquo;was becoming the
object of most particular attentions from matchmaking
mammas. My wife informs me that his
stock has been very high for some months past.
Gilt-edged, in fact. I&rsquo;m afraid there will be a slump
as soon as your resurrection is established. Henry,
I think, will bear up. Well now, about sending you
abroad&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but I rather think it
could be managed, if you still wish it, you know. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be in a hurry, if I were you, Luttrell, about
going abroad, but as to the matter in hand&mdash;well,
hurry is the word. You&rsquo;ll find a car outside with
Inspector Davison. Take him along. I hope he
won&rsquo;t be needed, but&mdash;well&mdash;take him along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Ember was spending a busy Sunday. As
he stood in the empty laboratory, realising
Molloy&rsquo;s defection and all that it involved, there was
no change in his impassive face. The web of his plan
was broken. Like some accurate machine his brain
picked up the loose ravelled threads and wove them
into a new combination.</p>
<p>Molloy himself was no loss. His place could be
filled a dozen times over. As to any harm that he
could do, unless he had gone straight to the police, he
could be reached&mdash;reached and silenced. And Ember
knew his Molloy. He would not go straight to the
police. If he meant to sell them, he would set about it
with a certain regard for appearances. There would
be <i>pourparlers</i>, some dexterous method of approach
which would save his face and leave him an emergency
exit. Ember checked over in his mind the four or five
places to which Molloy might have retreated. Then
there was the money. That they must have; but
Molloy, once found, could be scared into giving
it up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Ember let his eyes travel around the laboratory.
The lists lay upon the bench where Jane had put them
not five minutes before. He frowned and picked them
up, stared at them, and frowned more deeply still.
They had been folded and refolded, doubled into a
small package since he had last handled them. Who
had done it? The sheets had been smooth from the
typewriter when he gave them to Molloy. They had
been handled and creased, with the creases that come
from tight folding. Had Molloy meant to take them
with him, and then at the last moment been afraid?
It looked like it. He turned over the pages, counting
them. Suddenly his eyes fixed, his fingers tightened
their hold. There was a fresh smudge of ink on the
top of the fifth page&mdash;a smudge so fresh that the blue
ink had not yet turned black. That meant two
things: Molloy had copied the lists before he left, and
he had only been gone an hour or two&mdash;that at the
outside, probably less.</p>
<p>In the moment that passed before Ember laid the
papers down, Mr. Molloy received his death sentence
as duly and irrevocably as if it had been pronounced
by an Assize Judge in scarlet and ermine, white wig
and black cap.</p>
<p>Ember gave just a little nod, opened a safe that stood
in the corner, pushed the papers into it, and pocketed
the key.</p>
<p>It was a little later that he found the first spot
of candle grease. It was half-way up one of
the side passages, on the spot where Jane had
been standing when he and Molloy entered the
laboratory the evening before. He looked at it for
a long time very thoughtfully before he took his
torch and proceeded to a systematic search of the
passages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>He found no living person, but came upon dropped
wax in three more places, at the edge of the well, by
the headland exit, and half-way down the steps to the
beach. He came slowly back along the main passage,
and stood for some time with his light focused on the
sand which he had spread at the foot of the stair.
There was no footmark upon it, but he was prepared
to swear that it was not as he had left it. He had
scattered the sand loosely, and it was pressed down and
too smooth. He thought that it had been smoothed
by a hand passing over it. He mounted the first two
steps. The thread of cotton which he had fastened
across the stairway was still there. He bent beneath
it, came to the top, and threw his light full upon the
back of the panelled door. The second piece of cotton
was gone.</p>
<p>He flashed the ray upon the floor once&mdash;twice. The
third time he found what he was looking for, a fine
black thread lying across the threshold. It ran out
of sight under the door. Some one had gone out
that way since Mr. Ember had come in. Who?
Not Molloy&mdash;impossible that it could have been
Molloy.</p>
<p>Ember passed through the panel, closed it behind
him, and walked slowly and meditatively along the corridor
to the library, still pursuing his train of thought.
Molloy would have blundered through that first piece
of cotton without ever feeling it at all, just as Molloy&rsquo;s
foot in its heavy boot would have been unaware of the
sand. If it was a woman who had passed&mdash;now who
would have used a candle in the passages? Not
Raymond. She had more than one electric torch which
she used constantly for night work. But Renata, the
little soft-spoken stupid mouse of a thing, if she had a
fancy to go spying, she&rsquo;d take a candle; yes, and let it
gutter too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Mr. Ember&rsquo;s instinct for danger had always reacted
to this question of Renata Molloy. Over and over
again there had been the tremor, the response, the
warning prick. An extreme regret that he had not
arranged for a convenient accident to overtake Renata
possessed Jeffrey Ember. The omission, he decided,
should be rectified with as little delay as possible.
He locked the library door and went to the
telephone.</p>
<p>It took him half an hour to get the number that he
wanted, but he betrayed no impatience. When at last
a man&rsquo;s voice came to him, along the wire, he inquired
in the Bavarian dialect, &ldquo;Is that you, Number Five?&rdquo;
The voice said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whereupon Ember gave a password
and waited until he had received the countersign.
He then began to issue orders, using an unhurried
voice. Every now and then he shivered a little in the
early morning cold, and shrugged his coat higher about
his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are promoted. You go up to Four and come
on to the Council. I will notify you of the next
meeting. Number Three is a traitor. He left here
last night with copies of lists containing names of
all agents. It is believed that it is his design to
sell us. He has secreted a large sum of money, the
property of the Council. Before he is eliminated
he must be made to hand this over. Take down
the following addresses; he may be at any one of
them. Put Six and Seven on to finding and dealing
with him immediately.&rdquo; He read out the addresses,
and paused whilst they were repeated. He then continued
speaking:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall require the motor-boat off Withstead Cove
at nightfall. Yes, to-night, and without fail. A
change of base is imperative. Proceed first to ...&rdquo;&mdash;he
gave another address&mdash;&ldquo;and communicate
also with Ten. If Belcovitch has arrived tell
him that he is promoted to Three, and bring him with
you. The Council can then meet, as Number One
is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very slight gleam of something hard to define
broke for a moment the dull impassivity of Ember&rsquo;s
voice as he pronounced the last words. Then he
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened attentively whilst the voice reproduced
his own words. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all. We shall meet to-night,&rdquo; and rang
off.</p>
<p>He had breakfast alone with Jane, and ate it with a
good appetite. He talked very pleasantly too. Jane
wondered why every succeeding moment left her more
afraid. She had been up all night, of course. It
must be that, yes, of course, it must be that. She
faltered in the middle of some inane sentence and
stopped. Ember&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on her with an
entire lack of expression, yet behind those blank
windows she felt that there were strange guests.
It was like looking at the windows of a haunted
house, quite blank and empty, and yet at any
moment out of them might look some unimaginable
horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;You seem a little tired this morning, Miss Renata,&rdquo;
said Ember gently. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you follow Lady
Heritage&rsquo;s example and have your breakfast upstairs?
You don&rsquo;t look to me as if you had had much sleep.
You haven&rsquo;t been walking in your sleep again by any
chance, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane clenched her foot in Renata&rsquo;s baggy shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t always
know when I&rsquo;ve been doing it. What made you think
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just crossed my mind,&rdquo; said Ember. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
very dangerous habit, Miss Renata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane pushed her chair back and rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into the garden,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;this
room is too hot for anything. It&rsquo;s like....&rdquo; A
little devil suddenly commandeered her tongue.
She reached the door, opened it, and flung over her
shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the snake house at the Zoo, Mr.
Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran straight out into the garden after that, and
stayed there. She had the feeling that it was safer to
be in the open. She wanted to keep away from walls,
and doors, and passages. She saw no one all the
morning, and came back to lunch with her nerve
steadier. As soon as lunch was over, she went out
again. The hour in the house had brought her fears
back with reinforcements. She began to count the
hours before Henry could arrive. It was only half-past
two, and perhaps he would not come till
midnight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>The thought of the dark hours after sunset was like
a black cloud coming nearer and nearer. If she could
hide, if she could only get away and hide until Henry
came. She felt as if it was quite beyond her to go
back into the house and sit for hour after hour, perhaps
alone with Jeffrey Ember, his blank eyes watching
her, or to endure Raymond Heritage&rsquo;s presence,
and, looking at her, remember the line in Molloy&rsquo;s
letter: &ldquo;Renata followed Number One.&rdquo; It was
Raymond she had followed. She had told Molloy
that she had followed Raymond. Then Raymond,
beyond doubt or cavil, was the Number One of
that horrible Council. She could not bear it. She
thought of Raymond&rsquo;s voice breaking when she said
&ldquo;Anthony,&rdquo; and she could not bear it. If she could
only get away and hide until Henry came.</p>
<p>She went into the walled garden and walked up and
down. Perhaps Anthony Luttrell would come to her
as he had come once before. Presently she came to
the tool-shed, stopped for a moment hesitating on the
threshold, and then went in. There was a way into
the passages from here; she was quite sure of it.
If she could find the spring, she believed that she
would be able to reach the cross-passage where she had
run into Henry. She did not believe that Ember used
it. Why should he, since it would be of no use to his
schemes? If she could get into the passage and hide
there, she need not go back to the house. She could
wait there for Henry and catch him as he passed.
She would be able to warn him too, and it came to her
with startling suddenness that he stood very much
in need of warning; so much had come to light in the
forty-eight hours since he left.</p>
<p>It took Jane an hour to find the spring. She might
not have found it then, but for the chance that made
her slip and throw all her weight upon one place just
under the wide potting-shelf. There was a creak,
and one of the boards gave a little. She found a trap-door
and steps beneath it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>There were some old sacks in the shed. Jane took
one of them, climbed down the steps, and shut the
trap-door again. She felt her way down to the level,
spread the sack on the second step, and sat down.
She felt utterly forlorn and weary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Ember, having completed all his arrangements,
went in search of Lady Heritage.
She had sat silently through lunch and disappeared
directly afterwards. Having failed to find her downstairs,
Ember was about to pass along the upper
corridor to the steel gate which shut off the north wing,
when he noticed that the door of the small Oak Room
on his left was standing ajar. He thought he heard a
movement within, and, after pausing for a moment to
listen, he pushed the door wide and looked in. As
far as his knowledge went, Lady Heritage had never
entered this room during the time that they had been
in the house. He accepted the fact and could have
stated the reasons for it. It had been the playroom,
and the walls were covered with Anthony Luttrell&rsquo;s
school groups. The book shelves held his books, the
cabinets his collections. In a very intimate sense it
was his room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Raymond Heritage stood at the far end of it now.
She wore a dress of soft white wool bound with a
plaited girdle from the ends of which heavy tassels
swung. She had taken one of the groups from the wall
and was looking at it with an intensity which closed
her thought to all other impressions. She stood half
turned from the door. Ember looked at her and,
looking, experienced some strange sensations. This
was Raymond Carr-Magnus, a younger, softer, lovelier
woman than Raymond Heritage. The curious cold
something, like transparent glass or very thin ice,
which seemed to wall her from her fellows, was gone.
It was as if the ice had dissolved leaving the air misty
and tremulous.</p>
<p>The little flame which always burned in him took on
brightness and intensity, and a second flame sprang
up beside it, a flame that burned to a still white heat
of anger because this change, this softening, was for
Anthony Luttrell and not for Jeffrey Ember.</p>
<p>There was no sign of emotion, however, in face or
expression as he moved slightly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you busy? May I speak to you for a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Raymond that she did not
appear in the least startled. She turned quite slowly,
laid the photograph on the open front of the bureau
by which she stood, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now? Do you want me now?&rdquo; A softness was
in her voice as she spoke, and a dream in her eyes.</p>
<p>Her beauty struck Ember as a thing seen for the first
time. He had to use great force to keep his answer on
a note of indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can spare the time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Raymond looked round her. There was a caressing
quality in her glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll come downstairs,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>This was Anthony&rsquo;s room. She would not talk to
another man in Anthony&rsquo;s room. The thought may
have been in her mind. The breath of it beat on
Ember&rsquo;s flames and fanned them higher still. He led
the way downstairs and into Sir William&rsquo;s study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>Raymond Heritage had passed from the despairing
mood of her first interview with Anthony. Then to
know him alive and to feel him unforgiving had stabbed
her to the quick. But that phase had passed. During
the many hours that she had spent alone the one amazing
radiant thought that he was alive had come to
dominate everything. The cold finality of death had
been lifted. Instead of a blank wall, there opened
before her an infinite number of ways, any one of
which might lead her back to her lost happiness. She
began to live in the past, to go over the old times, to
make a dream her companion.</p>
<p>She came into the study with Ember and waited to
hear what he wanted, giving him just that surface
attention which he recognised and resented. His first
words were meant to startle her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Heritage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know, of course,
that there are certain passages and rooms under this
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did start a little, he thought. Certainly her
attention deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that, Jeffrey?&rdquo; she said, and hardly
heard her own voice because Anthony&rsquo;s rang in her ears
insisting, &ldquo;I <i>know</i> that you told Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Luttrell told me,&rdquo; said Ember.</p>
<p>She exclaimed incredulously. At least her thoughts
were not wandering now. Ember felt a certain
triumph as he realised it. He went on speaking quite
quietly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was when Sir William and I were down here the
year before Mr. Luttrell died. He, Mr. Luttrell, was
taken very ill and I sat up with him. In the night he
was delirious. It was obvious that he had something
on his mind. He began to talk about the passages and
to say that the secret must not be lost. He took me
for his nephew Henry March, and nothing would serve
him but he must show me the entrance in the hall. He
got out of bed, and was so much excited that I thought
it best to give way. When he had shown me the spring
he calmed down and went quietly back to bed. In the
morning he had forgotten all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond listened, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you tell me this?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I knew
Mr. Luttrell had told Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry March knows?&rdquo; said Ember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure he does. Why,
Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember was too busy with his thoughts to speak for
a moment. What an appalling risk they had run. If
Henry March knew of the passages, then they had been
on the very brink of the abyss all along. He spoke at
last, very seriously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come down with me into the passages
if you will. There&rsquo;s something I want to show you&mdash;something
which I think you ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to see for yourself. I&rsquo;d rather
not say any more if you don&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;ll show you
what I mean. I really think you ought to come and
see for yourself. This is a good time, as the servants
are safely out of the way and Miss Molloy seems to
have taken herself off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll come. I must get a cloak though,
or I shall get into such a mess. Those passages simply
cover one with slime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember stood still with his hand on the half-opened
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, once or twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lately?&rdquo; His voice was rather low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember gripped the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you know&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t think we need go into that.&rdquo; She
spoke gently but from a distance. As she spoke she
passed him and went through the hall and up the stairs.
The heavy tassels of her girdle knocked softly against
each shallow step.</p>
<p>Ember went on gripping the door until she came
down again wrapped in a long black cloak. When he
dropped his hand there was a red incised line across
the palm. He saw that the cloak was smeared with
green. How near to the edge they had been, how
horribly near!</p>
<p>He opened the door and lighted her down the steps
in silence, and in silence walked as far as the laboratory
turning. When he turned to the left and flashed
his light ahead of them, Raymond spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been along that passage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
know there are holes in some of them, and I&rsquo;ve never
liked the look of these side tunnels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s quite safe,&rdquo; said Ember, and led the
way.</p>
<p>Jane heard the murmur of their voices, and for a
moment saw the faint glow of the light. Then the
glow and the voices died again. It was dark, she was
alone, she was cold, she wanted Henry, oh, how she
wanted Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>At that moment Jane&rsquo;s idea of Paradise was to be
able to put her head down on Henry&rsquo;s shoulder and
cry. It was not, perhaps, a very exalted idea, but it
was very insistent.</p>
<p>When Ember switched on the light, swung open the
steel gate, and stood aside for her to pass, Lady
Heritage uttered a sharp exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I wanted you to see,&rdquo; replied Ember.</p>
<p>She crossed the threshold, walked a pace or two into
the room, and looked around her with eyes from which
all dreaminess had vanished. Bewilderment took its
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did this? What does it mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Ember did not answer her until he too was within
the chamber. He pushed the steel gate with his hand
and it fell to with a clang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, as you see, a well-equipped laboratory,&rdquo;
he said&mdash;&ldquo;worth coming to see, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but, Jeffrey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are interested? I thought you would be;
won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked about her with puzzled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do sit,&rdquo; said Ember in his quiet, friendly way.
&ldquo;You will find this chair more comfortable than the
benches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought it forward as he spoke&mdash;a high-backed
chair with arms. It struck her then as a curious
piece of furniture to find in a laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought here on purpose for you,&rdquo; said Ember.</p>
<p>But Raymond did not sit. Instead she rested her
hands lightly on the back of the chair, and, looking
across it, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey, what does all this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you,&rdquo; said Ember seriously. &ldquo;I
have brought you here to tell you, only I wish you
would sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. Jeffrey, what is this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A laboratory,&rdquo; said Ember. &ldquo;As you see, a
laboratory, and the scene of some extremely interesting
experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carried out by you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carried out by me ... and some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have brought other people in here? Jeffrey,
I think that was inexcusable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not yet attempted to excuse myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment his eyes met hers. She saw something,
a spark, a flash, from the flames within. It was her
first hint that there was, or could be, a flame there at
all. It startled her in just the same degree that an
actual spark touching her flesh would have startled
her&mdash;not more.</p>
<p>He spoke again at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now I called this place a laboratory. If I
were a poet&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed easily&mdash;&ldquo;I might have used
another word. I might have said, &lsquo;This is the crucible
out of which has come the new Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond lifted her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been touched by that medi&aelig;val
dream?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is the twentieth century,
Jeffrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ember slowly. &ldquo;Yes, the twentieth
century, and I said ... &lsquo;a <i>new</i> Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone.&rsquo;
The medi&aelig;val alchemists dreamed of something that
would turn all it touched to gold, that would transmute
the baser metals. I have found something which will
touch this base civilisation, this rotten fabric with
which we have surrounded ourselves, and dissolve
it. And when it is in solution there will be gold and
to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Lady Heritage.</p>
<p>Ember met her frown with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a week ago that I heard you say, &lsquo;If I
could smash it all&rsquo;? And didn&rsquo;t you sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah Love, could you and I with Fate conspire</p>
<p class="t0">To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,</p>
<p class="t">Would we not shatter it to bits, and then</p>
<p class="t0">Re-mould it nearer to the Heart&rsquo;s Desire?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>You sang that as if you meant it, Raymond. You
sang it with all your heart in your beautiful voice.
Well, Fate has conspired for you and given this sorry
scheme of things into your hands to shatter&mdash;to
shatter and re-mould.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond had been leaning a little forward over
the back of the chair, touching it lightly. She
straightened herself when Ember used her name, and
looked at him with a sort of grave displeasure. He
laughed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you begin to understand?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, Jeffrey, that I want to understand,&rdquo;
said Lady Heritage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How like a woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Ember. &ldquo;Here is
what you cried out for. Here is opportunity, power,
the greatest adventure that ever has been or ever
will be, and you are afraid to face it. I offer you
the throne of the world&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t wish to
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extreme quiet of his voice was in sharp contradiction
to the flamboyant words. Raymond looked
at him in some anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not well,&rdquo; she began, and then stopped
before the sarcasm of his glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a business
proposition. You&rsquo;ve had poetry, but I can give you
prose if you prefer it. I have discovered something&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t at this moment go into details&mdash;which enables
me to smash up civilisation as you&rsquo;d smash a rotten
egg. Every city, every town of the so-called civilised
world is accounted for, divided amongst my agents.
They only await my signal. Those alone whom we
mark for survival will survive, the rest are eliminated.
Remains a world at our disposal to recreate.
In that world I am supreme&mdash;and you. Is that plain
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face showed deep distress and concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey, indeed you&rsquo;re not well,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came a step towards her and saw her draw back,
as it were, involuntarily. &ldquo;Have I not made you
understand yet? Perhaps a little documentary evidence
will assist you?&rdquo; He took a quick step towards
her, looked at her full, and said in a different voice,
&ldquo;Raymond, I&rsquo;m in dead earnest&mdash;dead sober earnest.&rdquo;
Then with a sudden movement he turned away and
went across to the safe in the far corner of the
chamber. With his back to Raymond he unlocked it,
and occupied himself for a minute or two with the
picking out of some papers. When he turned she
was at the gate with her hand on it. He spoke at
once in his most ordinary voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a safety-catch. It won&rsquo;t open without
the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you open it, please?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>He said, &ldquo;No, Raymond,&rdquo; in a tone of cool finality,
and she lost colour a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey,&rdquo; she began, then paused and bit her
lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raymond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scarlet patch of anger came suddenly to her cheek
and she was silent until it had died again. Long years
of self-control do not go for nothing. When she spoke
at last there was only sadness in her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey, I have valued our friendship&mdash;very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will value my love even
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand dropped from the door. She did not
answer. The hope of moving him died. She drew
her cloak about her, crossed the floor slowly, and
seated herself in the chair. She did not look at
Ember.</p>
<p>When the last faint murmur of voices ceased, and
the dark silence closed about her, Jane sat quite still
for a while. It is very difficult indeed to keep one&rsquo;s
eyes open in the dark. Jane found that her lids
dropped, or else that the blackness became full of odd
traceries that worried and disturbed her. She felt
as if she had been there for hours and hours; and
she knew that it really might be hours before Henry
came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>She got up and walked slowly to where the passage
came out into the main corridor. She stood under the
arch and looked towards the laboratory turning. She
had only to feel her way as far as that, turn up it, and
she would come within sight of the lighted chamber
where Ember and Lady Heritage were talking. The
laboratory drew her, and the light drew her. She began
to move cautiously along the corridor. She had on
light house-shoes which made no sound.</p>
<p>The little glow which presently relieved the blackness
cheered her unreasonably. It was a danger signal
and she knew it, but it cheered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would rather be doing something dangerous
than just mouldering in the pitch dark,&rdquo; she told
herself, and edged slowly nearer and nearer to the
light.</p>
<p>She was now at the corner, and could look round it
and through the steel bars into part of the laboratory.
The disadvantage of her position was that she might be
taken in the rear by any one who came along either
the passage that she herself had come up or the slanting
passage with the well in it which ran into the other
at an acute angle, about six feet from where she was
standing.</p>
<p>Jane, however, knew of no one who was at all likely
to arrive except Henry. She therefore did not trouble
about her rear, but looked with all her eyes into the
laboratory. She saw Lady Heritage sitting in a tall
chair, a little turned away. Her right elbow rested
on one arm, and her chin was in her hand. Her eyes
were downcast. She was speaking in a cold, gentle
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not many friends&mdash;I thought you were my
friend. Was it all lies, Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ember came into view for a moment. He must
have been at the far end of the room. He came down
it now, walked past Lady Heritage, and turned to
face her. Jane saw his profile. He was smiling
faintly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not fond of lies,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they are very
entangling&mdash;so hard to keep one&rsquo;s head and remember
what one has said. Now the truth is so simple and
easy; besides, you may believe it or not, I really do
dislike lying to you. I have always told you the truth
where it was humanly possible to do so. Even in the
matter of Miss Molloy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage exclaimed suddenly and sharply,
lifting her chin from her hand and throwing her head
back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renata Molloy! She&rsquo;s in this wretched conspiracy
of yours, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; said Ember, speaking soberly
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what you told me wasn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of it was. I was really rather pleased with
my neat dovetailing. I&rsquo;ll run over it, and you&rsquo;ll see
that I told the truth whenever I could. All that about
my having known Molloy in Chicago&mdash;solid fact. Then
I think I said that I ran across him again in London,
and found he had taken Government service with
Scotland Yard&mdash;that was fiction, and so was the yarn
about his warning me that foreign agents were on the
track of the Government formula. But it&rsquo;s perfectly
true that he has a daughter, and that she sometimes
walks in her sleep. When I told you that she had come
in&mdash;sleep walking&mdash;during an important conversation
about the Government formula, and that neither Molloy
nor I was sure how much she had heard, I was
mingling fact and fiction. Renata Molloy happened in
on a meeting of The Great Council&mdash;that is the Council
of the managing agents from all the countries within
the scope of our operations, and no one knew what she
had heard, or what she understood. When I told you
that I thought she would be safer down here under my
own eye, and that I was not sure whether she had been
got at, I was speaking very serious fact indeed. They&rsquo;d
have killed her then and there if corpses were just a
little easier to dispose of in London. I now very much
regret that we didn&rsquo;t chance it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>A trembling bewilderment had descended upon
Jane. She saw Raymond stare for a moment at
Ember with a curious horrified look and then drop
her chin upon her hand again. Ember came a step
nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having disposed of that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should be
glad if you would just look at these papers. Documentary
evidence, as I said just now, is convincing.
This is a short summary of our plans which has been
issued to all managing agents. This is a list of those
agents. They form The Great Council. These four
names&rdquo;&mdash;he paused&mdash;&ldquo;I should have told you that
there was an Inner Council. It is the Inner Council
which really runs everything. There are four members.
I come Second, Molloy was Third, and Belcovitch,
who will be here presently, is Number Four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s heart beat faster and faster. She heard that
Belcovitch would be there presently, but she could not
tear herself away. She saw Raymond Heritage put
out her left hand for the papers and glance at them
indifferently, saw her brow contract as she read, saw
her drop the first two papers upon her lap and lift the
third. There was a dead silence whilst she read it.
It was the list which gave the names of the Inner
Council. She let it drop from her hand and an extraordinary
rush of colour transformed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is my name doing there?&rdquo; she said. Her
voice was not loud, but it rang.</p>
<p>Ember turned upon her a face from which all blankness
and coldness had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, the whole thing
has been built up round your name. The head of the
Council, the inspiration of the movement, the driving
force&mdash;you, you, Raymond, you. You are as indissolubly
knit with the plan as if you had conceived it.
The whole Council, The Great Council, knows you
as Number One of The Four who are the Inner Council.
The work has been done here under your auspices.&rdquo;
His air of excitement vanished suddenly, his voice
dropped to an ordinary note. &ldquo;I told you it was a
business proposition. I assure you that it has been
most adequately worked out. In the painful and
improbable event of criminal proceedings, you would
be cast for the chief r&ocirc;le. A wealth of corroborative
detail has been provided. In business, as you know,
one has to think of everything. I&rsquo;m showing you
the penalty of failure, but we shan&rsquo;t fail. I&rsquo;m showing
what success will mean. Think of it&mdash;the absolute
power to say, &lsquo;This shall be done.&rsquo; The absolute
power to impose your will! The absolute power to
blot out of existence whatever crosses it!&rdquo; A gleam
came into his eyes like nothing that Jane had ever
seen before. &ldquo;Raymond, I&rsquo;m not a visionary or a madman.
The thing is within my grasp. I&rsquo;m offering it to
you. It&rsquo;s yours for the taking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>Raymond did not speak. She only lifted her eyes
and looked at him. It was a long look. Whilst it
lasted Jane held her breath. Raymond looked down
again; there was silence.</p>
<p>Into the silence came a distant sound&mdash;a faint
dragging sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII</span></h2>
<p>Henry left his car at The Three Farmers on
the Withstead road, and proceeded with
energy towards the beach. He was glad enough to
walk after the long drive.</p>
<p>The day was chilly, the air full of moisture, and a
thin, cold mist was rising off the marshes. What
breeze there was came from the land and took the
mist only a few hundred yards out to sea. The motor-boat
telephoned for by Mr. Ember earlier in the day
ran into it as she came into Withstead Cove to land
a passenger. The passenger, who was Mr. Belcovitch,
was very glad indeed to be landed. He had no
nautical tendencies, and would have preferred danger
on dry land to safety at sea. He made his way up
the beach and, confused by the mist, went into the
wrong cave. As he turned to come out of it, having discovered
his mistake, he heard footsteps, and promptly
sheltered himself behind a convenient buttress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>Henry walked briskly past and, as Mr. Belcovitch
stared after him, disappeared into the next cave. He
disappeared and he did not return. Belcovitch heard
a familiar sound, the sound made by the pivoting stone
as it swung back into its place. He recognised it, and
became a prey to some rather violent emotions, of
which fear, hatred, and a desire to annihilate Henry
were the chief. Henry was unknown to him, therefore
Henry was not one of them. His walk, his
carriage, his whole appearance marked him out as
belonging to that class which Mr. Belcovitch made
a profession of detesting. He possessed the secret
of the passages, and was therefore in the highest
degree dangerous.</p>
<p>Belcovitch followed him as rapidly and as silently
as a man can follow whose very existence has for many
years depended on his proficiency in these respects.
He closed the stone behind him with a good deal more
care than Henry had taken, and, having done so,
went up the steps at a surprising rate and in a moment
had his quarry in view. Henry had switched on a
torch and was proceeding at a moderate rate down the
main passage. Belcovitch, moving after him like a
cat, did some rapid thinking. It would be very easy
to shoot, but it would make a noise. He fingered
a length of lead piping in one of his pockets and
thought with impassioned earnestness of the back of
Henry&rsquo;s neck. Yet, supposing that Ember knew of
Henry&rsquo;s visit&mdash;he did not want any unpleasantness
with Ember. It would probably be better not to
kill Henry in case it should prove that Ember would
rather have him alive. It was always better to be on
good terms with Ember. Molloy had fallen out with
him, and it appeared that at this very moment two
comrades were on their way to eliminate Molloy.
All this very rapidly.</p>
<p>He decided not to kill Henry. It was a pity, because
there was a most convenient well into which he could
have dropped him. He decreased the distance
between them and unfastened the black silk muffler
which he wore instead of collar and tie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>Henry pursued his unconscious path, his mind
occupied with Jane, and plans, and Jane, and Ember,
and Anthony, and Raymond, and Jane again. It is
to be regretted that he did not look behind him. The
villain ought not to be able to steal upon the hero in
the dark without being heard, but Henry had not had
Mr. Belcovitch&rsquo;s advantages. The latter had all the
tricks of the half-world at his command, and Henry
had not.</p>
<p>Just before the laboratory turning Belcovitch came
up with a quick run, and that was the first that Henry
heard of him. The next instant he felt himself tripped,
struggling desperately to keep his footing, slipped in
the slime, and came down choking, with a black silk
muffler tightly knotted about his throat. Belcovitch
was a very neat operator. First the trip, then the
twist, and then the chloroform bottle. He had never
made a crisper job of it. He took Henry by the heels
and proceeded to drag him along the passage towards
the laboratory, Henry being mercifully oblivious of
what was happening.</p>
<p>When Jane heard that faint dragging sound, she had
just about half a minute to decide which passage it
came from, and to get away down the other one. It
really took her less than thirty seconds to realise that
some one was coming by the way that she herself had
come, and to dart into the slanting passage which held
the well. A yard or two down she turned and stood
where she had stood to see Ember pass the day before.
Whoever was coming had no light. Of course they
could see the light from the laboratory and were steering
by it. It was a man coming; she could tell by the
tread. He was dragging something&mdash;something heavy.
What? Or who? Jane sickened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>A dark figure passed between her and the glow that
came from the laboratory. She took three light steps,
and saw that what he dragged behind him was a senseless
man&mdash;senseless or dead.</p>
<p>She heard Ember call out, &ldquo;Belcovitch, is that
you?&rdquo; And a voice with a strong foreign accent
answered.</p>
<p>Then a great many things seemed to happen at once:
the steel gate opened; the helpless man was dragged
in; and, as the gate fell to, there came Raymond
Heritage&rsquo;s scream.</p>
<p>Jane shook from head to foot. The scream cut like
a knife. Why did she scream like that? Who was it?
Who was it? Who <i>was</i> it? She got her answer in
Raymond&rsquo;s gasp of &ldquo;Henry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An inner blackness, much, much worse than that intolerable
dark which had oppressed her, swept between
Jane and everything in the world. When Raymond said,
&ldquo;Henry!&rdquo; the light went out of her world and left
it black. She heard Ember say, &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; but
she could not see Belcovitch&rsquo;s shrug and shake of the
head. She leaned against the wall and could not move.
I suppose that in that moment she knew that she really
loved Henry. It hurt&mdash;dreadfully.</p>
<p>Then she heard Raymond&rsquo;s voice again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done to him? Devils, devils!&rdquo;
And Ember:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Raymond, calm yourself. He&rsquo;s not dead,
nothing so crude. Mr. Belcovitch is an artist, and
Captain March will come round in a minute or
two and be none the worse. I&rsquo;m sorry you had a
shock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>Light, dazzling light flooded Jane&rsquo;s consciousness.
Henry wasn&rsquo;t dead. The dark was only a dream, and
she was awake again. She was very much awake,
and her whole waking thought was bent upon the
necessity of getting help for Henry before that dream
came true.</p>
<p>Ember and Belcovitch would murder him if they had
time. Raymond would make what time she could,
but in the end they would murder him unless Jane
could get help.</p>
<p>She turned, holding to the wall, and moved along the
passage. When she had taken a step or two something
happened which she could never think of without self-abasement.
Her nerve went suddenly, and she began
to run. It was only for a dozen steps; then her self-control
came into play. She pulled up panting, and,
after listening for a moment, crept the rest of the way,
reached the steps, and came out into the empty hall,
dirty, wet, and as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>As soon as she had the panel shut she ran across the
hall and down the corridor to the library. She shut
the library door with a sharp push, and was across the
room and taking down the telephone receiver before the
sound of the bang had died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exchange!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Exchange!&rdquo; and clenched
her hand as she waited for the reply. It came with
a dreamy accent, the voice of a girl disturbed in the
middle of Sunday afternoon. Nobody should be telephoning
in the middle of Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you look up a London number for me? Sir
Julian Le Mesurier&rdquo;&mdash;she spelt it. &ldquo;Please be very
quick; <i>please</i>, it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; said the dreamy voice incongruously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>Silence fell. Jane held on to the telephone, and tried
to control her breathing, which came in gasps. The
room seemed full of mist; she shut her eyes.</p>
<p>When Jane started to run down the laboratory
passage Jeffrey Ember was superintending the removal
of the black silk muffler from Henry&rsquo;s neck. When
they rolled Henry over on to his face he groaned, and
when they tied his hands behind his back with the
muffler he tried to kick, whereupon Ember produced a
piece of rope and they tied his ankles too.</p>
<p>The sound of Jane&rsquo;s running feet had come very
faintly upon Ember&rsquo;s ear. Henry was groaning and
kicking, and Belcovitch was cursing in a steady undertone.
It was not until he rose to get the piece of rope
that his mind took hold of that faint sound and began
to analyse it. There had been a sound in the passage
outside&mdash;some one moving&mdash;some one running. Yes,
that was it, some one running, light foot and very fast.</p>
<p>Ember finished tying Henry up and got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some one in the passage just now,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I must go and see. There was something; I
heard something. It was like some one running.&rdquo; He
spoke as if to himself, and then turned to Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will stay where you are in that chair&mdash;otherwise....&rdquo;
He swung round to Belcovitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she moves, shoot Captain March at once,&rdquo; he
said, and was gone, leaving the gate ajar behind him.</p>
<p>In the library Jane waited for her call. It came with
startling loudness&mdash;a bell that seemed to ring inside
her head&mdash;and then the dreamy voice drawling, &ldquo;Here
y&rsquo;are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Piggy&rsquo;s study Isobel Le Mesurier said, &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Lady Le Mesurier?&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell your husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Isobel&rsquo;s charming, friendly voice, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here.
Won&rsquo;t you speak to him yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s hearing, always acute, was strung to an
extraordinary pitch. She could hear the girl at the
exchange speaking to some one; she could hear Isobel
saying, &ldquo;Piggy, you&rsquo;re wanted&rdquo;; and behind these
sounds, on the extreme edge of what was perceptible,
she heard the click of the panel and Ember&rsquo;s footsteps
as he crossed the polished floor. She knew that they
were Ember&rsquo;s footsteps, and she heard them coming
nearer.</p>
<p>Sir Julian was speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane heard her own voice, and it sounded small and
far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane Smith, speaking from Luttrell Marches.
They&rsquo;ve got Henry in the passages. He&rsquo;s hurt.
They&rsquo;ve got a motor-boat in Withstead Cove. Help
as quickly as you can. Some one&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember was half-way down the corridor. Piggy was
speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony Luttrell&rsquo;s on his way&mdash;should be with you
any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember turned the handle. Jane called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you get me that number&mdash;oh, can&rsquo;t you
get it quickly?...&rdquo; And, as the door opened sharply,
she dropped the receiver and turned.</p>
<p>Ember came in&mdash;a new Ember. There was something
terrifying in his look, and he said harshly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to telephone,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;They take such
ages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>Mr. Ember&rsquo;s look was terrifying, but Jane was not
terrified. As she dropped the receiver something happened
to her which she did not understand. Within
the last half-hour she had felt an extremity of fear and
sudden anguish, violent relief, and again intensest fear
and suspense. From this moment none of these things
came near her. She moved among them, but they
did not touch her at all. The thing was like a play in
which she had her part duly written and rehearsed.
There was no sense of responsibility, only a stage upon
which she must play her part; and she knew her part
very well. She did not have to think, or plan, or
contrive. She knew what to do, and how and when
to do it. From the moment that she dropped the
receiver at the telephone she never faltered for an
instant.</p>
<p>Ember looked at her with eyes which saw every tell-tale
stain upon her dress and hands. The something
in his gaze which should have been frightening became
intensified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Heritage wants you in the study,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jane knew very well that he said the study because
the study was next to the door in the panelling. If she
refused to go, he would stun her or shoot her here. She
did not refuse, and walked down the corridor by his
side in silence. They crossed the hall, and Ember
kept between her and the stairs. Jane walked meekly
beside him with downcast eyes until he passed ahead
of her to open the study door. In that moment she
turned on her heel, sprang for the stairs and raced up
them, running as she had never run in her life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>Ember would not risk shooting her in the hall&mdash;she
felt sure of that&mdash;but he was after her like a flash, and
she had very little start. She reached for the newel
at the top and jumped the last three steps, with
Ember about two yards behind. Then down the corridor
with a rush and into her room, and the door
banged and locked as he reached it.</p>
<p>Jane wasted no time. She thought that Ember
would hesitate to break down the door until he had at
least tried promises and threats, but she was taking no
chances. She heard him speaking as she opened the
cupboard door and locked herself inside it. His voice
was only a murmur as she heaved up the trap-door
in the floor and climbed carefully down the ladder upon
which Henry had stood that night which seemed like
weeks and weeks ago. The catch in the wall at the
bottom was a simple handle like the one behind the
panelling. She emerged into the garden room, opened
the window, dropped out of it, and ran quickly and
lightly along the terrace, keeping close to the wall of
the house.</p>
<p>Ember talked through the door for five minutes.
His remarks ranged from persuasive promises to
threats, which lost nothing from being delivered in a
chilly whisper. At the end of the five minutes he put
his shoulder against the lock and broke it. He found
an empty room and a locked cupboard. When he had
broken the cupboard door and discovered nothing more
exciting than Renata&rsquo;s schoolgirl wardrobe, he went to
the open window and stared incredulously at the drop
to the terrace. Jane had turned the corner of the
house and was out of sight.</p>
<p>Ember came downstairs with the knowledge that he
must complete his business quickly if he meant to
bring it to any conclusion other than disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>He went straight to the library and rang up the
Withstead exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady who was telephoning just now, did
she get the number she wanted? She did? Would
you kindly tell me which number it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then the information came:
Sir Julian Le Mesurier! There was certainly no
time to be lost. Molloy and his daughter both traitors,
both spies, both in Government pay! Molloy should
be reckoned with by now, and some day without fail
he would reckon with Renata.</p>
<p>He came into the hall, and released the spring of the
hidden door. As the panel turned under his hand, he
heard the purr of a motor coming nearer. It drew up.
The bell clanged. Mr. Ember stepped into the darkness
and closed the panel behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII</span></h2>
<p>Anthony Luttrell&rsquo;s distaste for his errand
had certainly not lessened during the long
drive from town. He stood now on his own doorstep
facing a strange butler, and heard a formal &ldquo;Not at
home,&rdquo; in response to his inquiry for Lady Heritage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Molloy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at home,&rdquo; repeated Blotson.</p>
<p>If this was a reprieve it was an unwelcome one.
Anthony would very much have preferred to get the
thing over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; he said briefly, and walked past
Blotson into the hall. &ldquo;I am Mr. Luttrell,&rdquo; he explained,
and Blotson&rsquo;s resentment diminished very
slightly. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation he threw open
the study door and ushered Anthony into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Lady Heritage is in the house she will see me,&rdquo;
said Anthony. &ldquo;If she is out I should like to see
Miss Molloy or, failing her, Mr. Ember.&rdquo; He walked
to the window and stood there looking out until Blotson
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Heritage is out, sir, and Miss Molloy is out.
Mr. Ember was in just now, but he must have stepped
out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; said Anthony for the second time.</p>
<p>When Blotson had gone, he stood quite still, following
out a somewhat uneasy train of thought. As the
minutes passed, uneasiness merged into anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>Jane ran the whole way to the walled garden. Once
inside its door she made herself walk in order to get her
breath. When she came into the potting-shed she
knew just what she was going to do, and set about
doing it in a quiet, businesslike way. From a stack of
pots she took about half a dozen, broke all but two of
them, and gathered the sherds into the lap of her dress.
She put the two unbroken pots on the top of the
sherds. Then she took a sharp pruning-knife from the
shelf, opened the trap-door, and went down the steps.</p>
<p>As soon as she came into the main corridor she began
to put down the broken sherds, taking care to make no
noise. She laid a trail of them up to the laboratory
turning, and then all along the turning itself, disposing
them in the middle of the fairway in such a manner
as to ensure that they should not fail to be seen by any
one flashing a light along the passage. She put the
last two or three sherds in a little pile about a yard
short of the arch leading to the slanting passage with
the well in it. As she bent down there she heard
Belcovitch maintaining an impassioned Slavonic monologue
within the laboratory.</p>
<p>She stood in the archway, threw her two unbroken
pots against the opposite wall with all her might, and
then ran back down the well passage until it turned.</p>
<p>Everything happened just as she knew that it would
happen.</p>
<p>Belcovitch stopped talking and swore. It was a
polysyllabic curse, very effective. Then the steel
gate was flung open, and in three languages Mr.
Belcovitch demanded of the silence an account of what
was happening. His voice ran away into a hollow
echo, and died miserably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>Jane heard him stamp back into the chamber,
cursing, and return. This time he flashed a light
before him. Flattened against the wall, Jane saw its
glow reflected from the side of the passage in which
she was. Belcovitch had seen the sherds and was exclaiming
and muttering. She heard him pass the arch.</p>
<p>Jane stole to the mouth of the slanting passage.
Belcovitch was two yards away on her left, flashing
his light down the tunnel, seeing more broken pots,
and more and more, and swearing all the time, not
loudly but with considerable earnestness. Jane slipped
like a shadow across behind him and round the corner.
The steel gate was wide open. She ran through it and
into the lighted laboratory.</p>
<p>Henry lay on the stone floor in front of her, bound
hand and foot. He had rolled over on to his side and
was staring at the gate. Raymond had risen to her
feet, and was taking a half-step towards Henry as
Jane came running in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the gate,&rdquo; said Henry in a sharp whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another way out, and I don&rsquo;t think they
know it. Quick, Jane, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane slammed the gate. She had the pruning-knife
in her hand, and she was down on her knees and at
work on the black silk muffler before the sound of the
slam reached Mr. Belcovitch. When it did reach him
he spun round and came back at a run with a revolver
in his hand and murderous fury in his heart.</p>
<p>Jane cut through the last shred of silk, and because
Belcovitch&rsquo;s hand was shaking with rage his first bullet
missed her and Henry handsomely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up against the wall, quick!&rdquo; Henry commanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>As he spoke he was himself half rolling, half scrambling
towards the wall. His ankles were still tied, but
his arms were free. The second bullet just missed his
head. Jane cried out, and then they were both out of
the line of fire. Henry was breathing hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the knife,&rdquo; he panted, and began to saw at
some of the toughest rope he had ever come across.</p>
<p>Raymond had remained standing. She had retreated
almost to the end of the room and wore a
look of extreme surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call her Jane?&rdquo; she asked. Her
deep voice came through the racket with strange
irrelevance.</p>
<p>Belcovitch continued to make the maximum amount
of noise in which it is possible for a man and a revolver
to collaborate. He banged the steel gate in the intervals
of firing, and he cursed voluminously.</p>
<p>The rope gave, and Henry was half-way on to
his feet when there was a sudden cessation of all the
sounds. Raymond gave a warning cry, and Henry
caught at Jane&rsquo;s shoulder and straightened himself.
The steel gate was opening.</p>
<p>Jane said, &ldquo;Henry&mdash;oh, Henry darling!&rdquo; and there
came in Mr. Jeffrey Ember, very cool and deadly, with
his little automatic pistol levelled. Just behind him
came Belcovitch, a silent Belcovitch, at his master&rsquo;s
heel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>&ldquo;Touching scene,&rdquo; said Ember. &ldquo;Captain March, if
you don&rsquo;t put your hands up at once I shall shoot Miss
Molloy. From her last exclamation, I should imagine
that you&rsquo;d rather I didn&rsquo;t. Miss Molloy, go across to
the opposite wall and stand there. Belcovitch, kindly
keep your revolver against that young lady&rsquo;s temple,
but don&rsquo;t let it off till I give you leave. Raymond, I
should be glad if you would resume your chair. A
brief conversation is, I think, necessary, and I should
prefer you to be seated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood not far from the entrance, dominating the
room. The gate had been closed by Belcovitch.
Ember waited till his instructions had been carried
out; then he came a little nearer to Lady Heritage
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time presses, Raymond. I must go. I wish that
there were more time, for indeed I would rather not
have hurried you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane, with the muzzle of Belcovitch&rsquo;s revolver cold
against her temple, found her attention caught by
Ember&rsquo;s words. Time ... yes, that&rsquo;s what they
wanted&mdash;time. Piggy had said that Anthony might
arrive at any moment. When he did arrive and found
that they were all mysteriously absent, surely his first
thought would be to search the passages. She raised
her voice and said insistently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ember threw her a dangerous look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something I wanted to tell you,&rdquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it then, and be quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You called me Miss Molloy just now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jane, <i>no</i>!&rdquo; said Henry violently.</p>
<p>Mr. Ember echoed the remark made by Lady
Heritage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call her Jane?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I was going to tell you,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>&ldquo;You called me Miss Molloy, and I just thought I
would like you to know that I&rsquo;m not Renata Molloy.
It would make an untidy sort of finish if you went
away thinking that I was, and I hate things untidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little devil,&rdquo; said Ember ... &ldquo;a little
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane stuck her chin in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not Renata Molloy anyhow,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;No one would ever have called her a devil. She was
a white rabbit&mdash;a nice, quiet, tame white rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s voice failed suddenly on the last word. Yet
Mr. Ember had not looked at her again. His eyes went
past her to Belcovitch, and it was to Belcovitch that he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if she speaks again you
can shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long, slow shudder swept Jane. She leaned against
the wall and was silent, and she shut her eyes because
she could not bear to see Henry&rsquo;s face. Ember turned
back to Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hurry you.&rdquo; His voice was low and
confidential. &ldquo;What I have to offer, you know. It
is yours for the taking. Please don&rsquo;t make any mistake.
I have to change my base, it is true&mdash;I have even to
change it with some haste&mdash;but neither that nor anything
else can now affect my purpose and its achievement.
What I offered is, without any shadow of
uncertainty, mine to offer and yours to take, if you will
... if you will, Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>Raymond&rsquo;s sombre gaze dwelt on him as he spoke.
The whole scene affected her as one is affected by something
which is taking place at a great distance. She
did not seem able to adjust her mental focus to it.
Her mind seemed to be divided into two parts. One
of them was entirely and unreasonably preoccupied
with the relationship between Jane and Henry, and
the reason why Henry should have addressed Renata
Molloy as Jane. These thoughts seemed to circle as
continuously, and with as little aim, as goldfish in a
glass bowl. The other part of her mind was bruised
and sick because Jeffrey Ember had been her friend.
When he said, &ldquo;Will you, Raymond?&rdquo; she did not
speak. She looked at him in silence, and presently
made a slow gesture of refusal.</p>
<p>Ember came a step nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I was in dead earnest.
Perhaps you don&rsquo;t realise just what I mean by that.
I&rsquo;ve played for a high stake, and I mean to have what
I&rsquo;ve played for or nothing. I&rsquo;ve played for you, and
if....&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;Let me put it this way.
Either we make the future together or there&rsquo;s no future
for either of us. I&rsquo;m speaking quite soberly when I tell
you this. Think well before you answer, but don&rsquo;t be
too long. If there is to be no future our present will
end here and now. This place is mined, and if I press
that unobtrusive knob, which you may notice above
the safe, the end will be quite a dramatic one. I have
always had some such contingency in view, and this
makes as good a stepping-off place as any other. Think
before you refuse, Raymond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head again. Her eyes never left his
face. Ember made an impatient gesture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are your friends going to thank you?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You are taking the heroic pose, and forgive me if I
say that it&rsquo;s a little unworthy of you. I expected something
less obvious. Take my offer, and I guarantee to
leave Captain March and Miss Molloy here unharmed.
Can any woman resist sacrificing herself? Come, will
you save them, Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Heritage spoke for the first time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that I must be a fool because I trusted
you.... I did trust you, Jeffrey ... but I don&rsquo;t
know what you have ever seen in me to make you
suppose that I am such a fool as to trust you
again ... now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words and her voice caused a change in Ember,
a change as difficult to define as to describe. It is
best realised by its effect upon those present. Some
impression of shock was received in varying degree by
them all. Henry March had, perhaps, the most vivid
sense of it. In Belcovitch it bred panic.</p>
<p>Whilst Ember was speaking the hand that held the
revolver to Jane&rsquo;s temple had become more and more
unsteady. The muzzle knocked cold against her
cheek bone and jabbed against her ear. Jane wondered
when the thing would go off. So, it is to be
imagined, did Henry, for he was grey about the mouth
and his forehead was wet.</p>
<p>Ember did not speak for a moment. Then he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch&eacute;!&rdquo; in a queer, bitter voice.</p>
<p>Belcovitch began to mutter in an undertone that
gradually became louder. His hand shook more and
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Raymond?&rdquo; said Jeffrey Ember. &ldquo;Quite,
quite sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came up quite close, and laid his right hand
lightly on her shoulder. It was the first time that he
had touched her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>She said just the one word, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; For a moment
his hand closed hard upon her. Then he sprang back
with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then we go up together.&rdquo; And, as he
spoke, he made for the corner where a little vulcanite
knob showed above the steel safe.</p>
<p>With a sort of howl Belcovitch whirled to meet him.
They crashed together and grappled, Ember silent,
Belcovitch torrential in imprecation and fighting as
a man frenzied with terror does fight. His revolver
dropped from his hand, and Ember stumbled over it.</p>
<p>Like a flash Henry had Raymond by the arm, whilst
his eyes commanded Jane and he pointed to the
passage that led out of the laboratory on the extreme
right. It was the one that Jane had explored first,
and as she ran into it she remembered that it ended
in a small chamber full of packing-cases. In a panting
whisper she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must shift them,&rdquo; said Henry, and,
groping in the almost dark, he began to pull the cases
away from the right-hand wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light&mdash;he can&rsquo;t find the spring without a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond heard her own voice saying this, and then
she ran back down the passage and into the laboratory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>Belcovitch had put his torch down on the bench
from which Jane had taken the lists. Its exact position
was, as it were, photographed on Raymond&rsquo;s consciousness.
She reached, snatched it, and was back
again in the least possible space of time. As she came,
she saw Ember and Belcovitch swaying, struggling&mdash;horribly
near the corner. And as she went she had
an impression of Belcovitch falling and, as he fell,
dragging Ember down with desperate, clawing hands.
Then she was trying to steady her hand and throw the
light upon the wall space which Henry had cleared;
but the beam wavered and shook, shook and wavered;
and Jane took the torch out of her hand, setting it on
one of the packing-cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be here. It should be just here&rdquo;&mdash;Henry
spoke in a muttering whisper; then with sharp irritation,
&ldquo;Nearer with that light, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane held it closely to the wall. Henry&rsquo;s hands slid
up and down, feeling ... pressing. Once they heard
Belcovitch shout, and all the time the sound of the
struggle filled their straining ears. Some one fired a
shot&mdash;and Henry found the spring. A slab of stone
swung outwards, pivoting as the other doors had
done.</p>
<p>Henry pushed Jane through the opening, flung his
arm round Raymond, dragged her through and
slammed the stone into place. They were in the narrow
alley-way between the row of veronica bushes and the
terrace wall, on the spot where Mr. George Patterson
had stood listening to Raymond&rsquo;s voice. The air, the
daylight, the mist, seemed wonderful beyond words.
Jane never again beheld a mist without remembering
that joyful lift of the heart which came to her when
the stone shut and she drew her first long, free breath.
Henry gave her no time to savour the joys of freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, run like blazes!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Jane ran. Once she started she felt as if nothing
would ever stop her. She heard Henry just behind
her; she heard him urging Raymond on, and they
came out of the alley-way round the end of the terrace,
round the side of the house.</p>
<p>Then it came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>The ground shook; there was a muffled thud and a
long, heavy rumble that died slowly. Then with a
terrific crash two of the stone urns along the terrace
wall fell and broke. As the noise ebbed there came
the tinkling sound of splintered glass falling upon
stone.</p>
<p>Jane stopped running as if she had been shot, and
reeled up against Henry, who put his arms round her
and held her tight. Up to that very moment the
feeling of unreality, of playing a part in a play for
which she had no responsibility whilst her real self
looked on remotely&mdash;this feeling had dominated her.
Now it was as if the curtain fell and she, Jane, was left
groping amongst events that terrified her. She trembled
very much, and clung to Henry, who was at that
moment the one really safe and solid thing within
reach.</p>
<p>Raymond did not pause or turn her head, but walked
straight on towards the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIX</span></h2>
<p>The last rumble of the explosion had hardly
died away before Anthony Luttrell had flung
open the study door, and was making his way at a
run towards the Yellow Drawing-Room.</p>
<p>At the glass door which led on to the terrace he
halted, opened it wide, and stood on the step looking
out. Some glass was still falling from the broken
windows on this side of the house. All the terrace
on the right of where he stood was like a drawing in
which the perspective has gone wrong. There was a
great bulge in one place, and some of the paving-stones
were tilted aslant, whilst others had fallen in, leaving a
gaping hole over which a cloud of dust was settling.</p>
<p>Anthony turned his back upon all this and came
back with great strides into the hall. Without so
much as a look behind him to see whether he was
observed, he loosened the spring, pushed open the
door in the panelling and there halted, suddenly remembering
the need of a light. He went back for a
torch, and then passed down the steps without waiting
to close the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>That something appalling had happened was obvious.
With the self-control without which it is impossible
to meet an emergency Anthony kept his thought
focused upon what he was doing. At the bottom of
the steps the way was still clear. He saw Jane&rsquo;s
broken pots and wondered what on earth they were
doing there. Then he turned into the laboratory
passage, flashing the light ahead of him. Half-way
along the passage the roof had fallen in.</p>
<p>Anthony turned, came back into the main corridor,
ran along it until he came to the place where the well
passage joined it. Here he turned off, made his way
cautiously past the well, and again found a mass of
stone and rubble blocking his path. A cold horror
came over him, and all those thoughts to which he had
barred his mind came insistently nearer, pressing past
those barriers and taking his consciousness by storm.
He came back into the hall and shut the door in the
panelling.</p>
<p>The hall was quite empty, but the voice of Blotson
could be heard at no great distance. It was raised in
exhortation and rebuke. Obviously he rallied a staff
which inclined to hysteria, for one could hear a
woman&rsquo;s sobs and a subdued chorus of perturbation
and nervous inquiry.</p>
<p>Anthony went to the front door and flung it open.
His car stood at a little distance, the inspector and the
chauffeur in close conversation. Anthony did not see
them. He only saw Raymond Heritage, who was
coming slowly up the steps. She was bareheaded, and
her face was very pale. She wore a white dress with
a black cloak over it. She stumbled twice as she
climbed the steps and, if Anthony was only conscious
of seeing her, she did not appear to be conscious of
seeing any one at all.</p>
<p>It was only when the hand which she put out in front
of her actually touched Anthony that she lifted her
eyes and looked at him. Then she said in an odd,
piteous sort of voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What has happened, Raymond?
Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must speak to you&mdash;I must,&rdquo; she said, catching
at his arm and drawing him towards the study. They
went in, and when the door was shut she turned to
him with the tears running down her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, you heard? I think he&rsquo;s dead. That place
downstairs was mined, and he tried to kill us all, only
we got away, Henry, the girl, and I. But Jeffrey&rsquo;s
dead&mdash;yes, I think he must be dead, and I know now
what you thought. I didn&rsquo;t know what you meant
before, but I know now. You were wrong, Tony.
Oh, Tony, won&rsquo;t you believe me? I didn&rsquo;t tell him
about the passages, and I didn&rsquo;t know anything until
to-day. They can tell you I was speaking the truth&mdash;Henry
and Miss Molloy; but, oh, Tony, can&rsquo;t you
believe me, just me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony looked at her, and looked. His face was
twitching. As her voice broke on the last two words
he dropped to his knees, flung his arms about her, and
hid his face in the folds of her cloak.</p>
<p>By the time that Jane and Henry came into the
house Blotson had set all his machinery running once
more. He himself presented a magnificent front to
two of the most dishevelled people whom he had ever
been called upon to receive. It was not until afterwards
when it came home to Henry how much green
slime there was in his wildly ruffled hair, and how little
the original colour of his collar could be discerned, that
he realised how marvellous had been the unflinching
calm of Blotson. He referred neither to the explosion
nor to Henry&rsquo;s appearance. In point of fact, what
were emergencies and accidents that Blotson should
notice them? The hour being five o&rsquo;clock, it was his
business to announce tea. He announced it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tea is served in the library,&rdquo; he said, and passed
upon his way.</p>
<p>But in the library the tea cooled while Henry, very
much relieved to find that the wires had not been cut,
galvanised the Withstead exchange and got on to a distinctly
relieved Sir Julian.</p>
<p>They arranged, speaking in Italian, that an explosion
had occurred in the course of an important experiment
in Sir William&rsquo;s laboratory. It was agreed to notify
Sir William and the press. The loss of two lives was
greatly to be deplored. When this was finished Piggy
became less official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl of yours is a brick; you can tell her so
from me. She&rsquo;s all right, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that Jane was quite all right.
He sounded a trifle puzzled.</p>
<p>Piggy laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know she had rung me up to say you&rsquo;d
been nobbled? Most businesslike communication I&rsquo;ve
ever had from a lady in all my life. Told me they&rsquo;d
got a motor-boat in Withstead Cove. And, thanks to
her, we ought to have gathered it in. I got through
to the coastguard station at once. Now look here,
what&rsquo;s the likelihood of laying hands on Ember&rsquo;s
papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ember&rsquo;s papers?&rdquo; repeated Henry. &ldquo;Well, there
was a safe down there, and that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;d be most
likely to keep them; but I expect they&rsquo;re all gone to
blazes, as the door was open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Jane&rsquo;s voice came in breathlessly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, wait, keep him on the line!&rdquo; she said,
and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jane, sir,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s gone
to get something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of Piggy&rsquo;s subsequent instructions
Jane came back. She held a bundle of closely written
sheets. She spread them before Henry&rsquo;s eyes, holding
them fan-wise like a hand at cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten them till you said that about the
papers&mdash;I&rsquo;d actually forgotten them. It&rsquo;s lists of his
agents in all the big towns everywhere. I sat up all
night copying them because I didn&rsquo;t dare keep the
originals. I keep forgetting you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s
been happening. But tell him, Henry, tell him we&rsquo;ve
got the lists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry told him.</p>
<p>Jane heard Sir Julian answer, and then Henry hung
up the receiver and hugged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say? Henry, you&rsquo;re breaking my
ribs! What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, you&rsquo;re a brick, and a wonder, and a darling,
and he said&mdash;he said, &lsquo;Bless you, my children!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
